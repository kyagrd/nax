\section{Summary}

%% \subsection{Ongoing and future work}
Here is the list of ongoing and future work:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Embedding Nax into strongly normalizing calculus}
	As mentioned in \S\ref{sec:theory}, we can prove the desired properties
	of Nax by embedding the features of Nax, most importantly,
	the Mendler-style recursion combinators into the calculus
	equipped with those desired properties. We have already done this for
	some of the combinators: \textsf{MIt} and \textsf{MsfIt} into \Fi, and,
	\textsf{MPr} into \Fixi. We believe that the course-of-values
	combinators \textsf{McvIt} and \textsf{McvPr} are also embeddable
	into \Fixi.
\item \emph{Correctness of the type inference algorithm}\\
	TODO
\item \emph{Large eliminations}\\
	The current prototype of Nax only supports limited
	form of large elimination of mapping indices from
	argument types to result types due to the limited syntax
	of the index transformer. We are trying to enrich the index
	transformer syntax for more expressive large eliminations
	(\eg, if-then-else or more generally case expressions
	in index transformers) and still maintain our design goals of
	having type inference and logically consistent type system.
	Again, we will make sure that such new features are safe by embedding
	the new feature into the calculus Nax is based on, such as System \Fi.
\item \emph{Generalized arrow types in Mendler-style combinators}\\
	For kinds other than
\item \emph{Non-logical language fragments}\\
	Trellys project \cite{TODO_cite_some_trellys_papers}
\end{itemize}
