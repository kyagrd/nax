This is a directory for the IFL 2012 post-preceeding submission, which will be
a revised revised version of the draft-proceeding submission in draft/design
directory. Since the page limit is only LCNS format 16 pages, we are goning to
re-work from scratch rather than trying to cut down from the draft-proceeding.

In the draft-proceeding submission, we mainly focued on a tutorial style
introduction to Nax including the two level types and the Mendler-style
combinators, but only gave rather simple example uses of indexed datatypes
(e.g. proof of even and odd length indexed lists). Considering the page limit
and already published work on Mendler-style combinators, we think the main
focus of the paper should be that interesting examples of inexed datatypes
are programmable in Nax. For example, illustrating typed interpreter for
a very simple language in Nax is what we have in mind.
