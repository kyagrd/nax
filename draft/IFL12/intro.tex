\section{Introduction}
During the past decade, the functional programming community achieved
partial success in their goal of maintaining fine-grained properties
by moderate extensions to the type system of functional languages
\cite{CheHin03,CheHin02,Xi03}.
This approach is often called \emph{``lightweight''}\footnote{e.g.,
  \url{http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/lightweight-dependent-typing.html} }
since using a full blown proof assistant to maintain similar properties
is likely to require much more effort (heavyweight).

The Generalized Algebraic Data Type (GADT) extension implemented
in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) has made this approach
widely avialibe to everyday functional programming tasks.
OCaml encodings of GADTs has been reported \cite{ManStu09}
and recent versions of OCaml supports GADTs natively \cite{GarNor11}.

Unfortunately, implementations supporting a lightweight approach (\eg, GHC)
lack \textbf{correctness guarantees} and \textbf{type inference} in general.
In addition, those implementations often lack support term indexing,
so \textbf{term indices are faked} (or, simulated) by additional
type structure replicating the requisite term structure.
A recent GHC extension, datatype promotion,
