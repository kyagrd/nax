TODO

In a theoretical setting

All terms typable in Curry-style System \Fw\ [TODO cite] are typable
in System \Fi\ with the same type, and all terms typable in \Fi\ are
typable in ICC \cite{Miquel01} with the same type. So, the subject reduction
and strong normalization of \Fi\ can be automatically derived from ICC.
ICC is more than just a dependent extension of \Fi, as described in our work,
since ICC includes $\eta$-reduction and the extensionality typing rule.
We do not foresee any problem of adding $\eta$-reduction and
the extensionality typing rule to \Fi. However, System \Fi\ enjoys
the erasure property (TODO internal cite), which ICC does not provide.

In \S\ref{ssec:rationale}, we have mentioned that Curry-style calculi enjoys
better reduction properties (\ie, Church-Rosser) than Church-style calculi. 
\citet{Nederpelt73} showed a counterexample that the Church-Rosser property
does not generally hold for $\beta\eta$-reduction of Church-style terms.
\citet{Geuvers92} proved that the Church-Rosser for $\beta\eta$-reduction
holds in functional PTSs. \citet{Seldin08} discusses the relation between
the Church-style typing and the Curry-style typing.
