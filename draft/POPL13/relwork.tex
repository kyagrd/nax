In a theorectical setting

System \Fi\ is between Curry-style System \Fw\ and
the Iimplicit Calculus of Constructions (ICC) \cite{Miquel01}.
So subject-reduction property is juts automatic from ICC
ICC is more than just a dependent version of \Fi, as dscribed in our
work, is that ICC includes $\eta$-reduction and the extensionality typing rule.
We see no problem of adding $\eta$-reduction and the extensionalty typing rule
to \Fi.

why Curry style is often preferable
\citet{Nederpelt73} showed a counterexample that the Church-Rosser property
does not generally hold for $\beta\eta$-reduction of Church-style terms.
\citet{Geuvers92} proved that the Church-Rosser for $\beta\eta$-reduction
holds infunctional PTSs. \citet{Seldin08} discusses the relation between
the Church-style typing and the Curry-style typing. 


In a more practial setting (for language implementation)

"Giving Haskell a Propmotion" \cite{YorgeyWCJVM12}
most closely reated work would be this

F-star from MSR
\cite{Swamy11}

what others to discuss?
