Thanks for the many fine comments

1) We agree with the comments mentioning that most proofs should be
omitted and that the real (as opposed to rough) statements should be
given.  In this respect, we would like to promise that the paper will
be revised accordingly.  

2)
Some referees want more motivation and [real]
examples.  Some of this could be included in the reply with the
promise of more to follow in the revised paper; though I don't know
whether the reply allows enough space to do this.  There are a lots of
other little points that could and should be addressed, but I guess
that not much can be done at this point and they are to remain as




3) We would like to address a few of the comments made by referee #57B.

He states that there is a significant technical concern on our theorems,
especially on Index Erasure Theorem (theorem 8), but it is clear that his
concern on theorem 8 comes from a very basic misunderstanding on the
syntactic definition of the typing context \Delta (which is in fairly standard
form, nothing exotic).

The beginning part of his comment where he tries to suggest a counterexample
is quoted below:

The \Delta he suggests here is _syntactically_ invalid. \Delta is a context
that contains bindings of type level variables (i.e., either X^\kappa or i^A).
Note, A^* (where A is not a type variable X) is not even syntactically valid!
Trying to construct counterexample from syntactically invalid context will
only be a vacuous argument.

We do very appreciate his very detaild comments on improving clarity of our
proof layout (.e.g. which part is too detailed, which parts needs more explicit
reference to definitions). However, his "significant technical concern" on our
main theorem (theorem 8) is clearly a misunderstanding.
