We are exploring whether Leibniz equality over indices
(i.e., $s_1=s_2$ encoded as $\forall X^{A -> *}.X\{s_1\} -> X\{s_2\}$)
may help us express functions whose domains are restricted by term-indices
(e.g., \verb|vtail :: Vec a {S n} -> Vec a n|). We wonder what extension
we need to enable large eliminations (i.e., computing types from term-indices).
We are also developing a programming language Nax, which supports
type inference with little annotation, based on System \Fi.
