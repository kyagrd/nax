\section{Introduction}

We have designed and implemented a prototype of Nax, which is
a strongly normalizing functional language supporting following features:
\begin{description}
\item[Indexed types with static term indices]
An indexed type is a family of types indexed by varying type arguments,
called indices. Both types and terms can appear as indices in Nax.
We focus on term indices since type indices are rather mild extension to
the type system compared to term indices.
Indices are static in Nax. That is, indices are only used for type checking
but computationally irrelevant. For instance, using length indexed lists
should be no less efficient than using ordinary lists without indices in Nax.

\item[Recursive types of unrestricted polarity but restricted elimination]
It is well known that unrestricted recursive types enable diverging computation
even without any recursion at term level. To design a normalizing language
that support recursive types, we should make a design choice that limits
the ability of recursive types in one way or another. There are two possible
design choices. We may restrict either the formation of recursive types
(\ie, type definition) or the elimination of recursive types
(\ie, pattern matching). We choose the latter for Nax.

\item[Mendler style iteration and recursion combinators]
Any practically useful normalizing language needs principled recursion
combinators, which allow limited forms of recursion guaranteed to normalize.
Since Nax allows indexed types, we need recursion combinators that accommodate
to arbitrary indices. Since Nax allows arbitrary recursive type formation,
we need recursion combinators that guarantee normalization for arbitrary
recursive types. Mendler style iteration and recursion combinators suit
those needs to handle indexed types and arbitrary recursive types.
