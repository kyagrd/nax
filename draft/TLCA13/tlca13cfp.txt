================================================================

The 11th International Conference on Typed Lambda Calculi
and Applications (TLCA 2013) is a forum for original
research in the theory and applications of typed lambda
calculus, broadly construed.
Suggested, but not exclusive, list of topics for submission are:

* Proof-theory: natural deduction, sequent calculi, cut elimination
  and normalization, propositions as types, linear logic and proof
  nets, type-theoretic aspects of computational complexity
* Semantics: denotational semantics, game semantics, realisability,
  domain theory, categorical models
* Types: subtypes, dependent types, polymorphism, intersection types
  and related approaches, type inference and type checking, types in
  program analysis and verification, types in proof assistants
* Programming: foundational aspects of functional programming,
  object-oriented programming and other programming paradigms,
  flow analysis of higher-type computation, program equivalence,
  program transformation and optimization


IMPORTANT DATES

* Paper Registration (titles & short abstracts): 25 January 2013
* Full Paper Submission: 1 February 2013
* Author Notification: 22 March 2013
* Camera-Ready Paper for the Proceedings: 12 April 2013


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We solicit submissions of research papers, which must:
* be in English and not exceed 15 pages (including figures and
  bibliography). Additional material intended for the reviewers
  but not for publication in the final version - for example
  details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix
  that is not included in the page limit. Reviewers will be told
  that they may choose to ignore the appendix.
* present original research which is unpublished and not submitted
  elsewhere (conferences, journals, books, etc.)
* use the Springer-Verlag LNCS style.
* be submitted electronically in PDF via the EasyChair TLCA 2013
  Submission Webpage (will open nearer the deadline)
  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tlca2013  .

Submissions deviating from these instructions may be rejected
without review. A condition of submission is that, if accepted,
one of the authors must attend the conference to give the
presentation. The proceedings will be published as a volume
in the ARCoSS subline series of Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in
Computer Science. Final papers will be in the format specified by
Springer-Verlag. Any questions regarding the submission guidelines
should be directed to the Programme Committee Chair
(Masahito Hasegawa <hassei@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx>) prior to
submitting.


COLOCATED EVENTS

TLCA 2013 is organized as part of the Federated Conference on
Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming (RDP 2013), together with
the International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and
Applications (RTA 2013) and several related events. Details on
workshops affiliated with RDP 2013 will be available at the web
site in due course.
