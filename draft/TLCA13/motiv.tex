\section{Motivation: from System~\Fw\ to System~\Fi, and back}
\label{sec:motiv}
It is well known that datatypes can be embedded into polymorphic lambda
calculi by means of functional encodings
%% such as the Church and Boehm-Berarducci encodings~
\cite{BoehmBerarducci}.

In System~\textsf{F}, one can embed \emph{regular datatypes},
like homogeneous lists:\vspace*{-3pt}
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\text{Haskell:} & \texttt{data List a = Cons a (List a) | Nil} \\
\text{System \textsf{F}:}~& 
\texttt{{List}}\:\: A\:\:\triangleq\:\:
\forall X.
(A\to X\to X) \to X \to X ~~\; \\
&
\quad~~
\texttt{Cons} \triangleq \l w.\l x.\l y.\l z.\,y\;w\,(x\;y\;z),~
\texttt{Nil} \triangleq \l y.\l z.z
\end{array}
\]\vskip-1ex\noindent
In such regular datatypes, constructors have algebraic structure that
directly translates into polymorphic operations on abstract types as
encapsulated by universal quantification over types (of kind $*$).

In the more expressive System \Fw\ (where one can abstract over
type constructors of any kind), one can encode more general
\emph{type-indexed datatypes} that go beyond the regular datatypes.
For example, one can embed powerlists with heterogeneous elements
in which an element of type \texttt{a} is followed by
an element of the product type \texttt{(a,a)}:\vspace*{-3pt}
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\text{Haskell:} & \texttt{data Powl a = 
        PCons a (Powl(a,a))
        | 
        PNil 
} \\
& \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
  \textcolor{gray}{\small\texttt{-- PCons 1 (PCons (2,3) (PCons ((3,4),(1,2)) PNil)) :: Powl Int}}\\
\text{System \Fw:}~& \texttt{{Powl}}\:\triangleq\:
\lambda A^{*}.\forall X^{*\to*}. (A\to X(A\times A)\to X A) \to X A \to XA
\end{array}
\]\vskip-1ex\noindent
Note the non-regular occurrence (\texttt{Powl(a,a)}) in the definition of
(\texttt{Powl a}), and the use of universal quantification over
higher-order kinds ($\forall X^{*\to*}$).
The term encodings for {\small\tt PCons} and {\small\tt PNil} are exactly
the same as the term encodings for {\small\tt Cons} and {\small\tt Nil},
but have different types.

What about term-indexed datatypes?  What extensions to System~\Fw\ are
needed to embed term-indices as well as type-indices?  Our answer is
System~\Fi.

In a functional language supporting term-indexed datatypes, we envisage
that the classic example of homogeneous length-indexed lists would be
defined along the following lines (in Nax-like syntax):
\vspace{-3pt}
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily\small},language=Haskell]
   data Nat = S Nat | Z 
   data Vec : * -> Nat -> * where
     VCons : a -> Vec a {i} -> Vec a {S i}
     VNil  : Vec a {Z}
\end{lstlisting}\vskip-1ex\noindent
Here the type constructor~{\tt Vec} is defined to admit parameterisation
by both type and term-indices.  For instance, the type 
(\verb|Vec (List Nat) {S (S Z)}|) is that of two-dimensional
vectors of lists of natural numbers.  By design, our syntax directly
reflects the difference between type and term-indexing by enclosing
the latter in curly braces.  We also make this distinction in 
System~\Fi, where it is useful within the type system
to guarantee the static nature of term-indexing.

The encoding of the vector datatype in System~\Fi\ is as follows:\vspace*{-3pt}
\begin{equation*}\label{FiVecType}
\texttt{{Vec}}
\triangleq
\begin{array}[t]{l}
\lambda A^{*}.\lambda
i^{\texttt{{Nat}}}.  \forall X^{\texttt{{Nat}}\to *}.
  (\forall j^{\texttt{{Nat}}}.A\to X\{j\}\to X\{\texttt{{S}}\; j\})
  \to X\{\texttt{{Z}}\}
    \to X\{i\}
\end{array}
\end{equation*}\vskip-1ex\noindent
where $\texttt{{Nat}}$, $\mathtt Z$, and $\mathtt S$ respectively encode
the natural number type and its two constructors,  zero and successor.
Again, the term encodings for {\small\tt VCons} and {\small\tt VNil} are exactly
the same as the encodings for {\small\tt Cons} and {\small\tt Nil},
but have different types.

Without going into the details of the formalism, which are given in the
next section, one sees that such a calculus incorporating term-indexing
structure needs four additional constructs (see \Fig{FiSyntax} for the
highlighted extended syntax).
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
  Type-indexed kinding~($A\to\kappa$), as in $(\texttt{{Nat}\ensuremath{\to}*})$
  in the example above, where the compile-time nature of term-indexing
  will be reflected in the typing rules, enforcing that $A$ be a closed
  type~(rule~$(Ri)$ in \Fig{FiTyping}).

\item 
  Term-index abstraction~$\lambda i^A.F$~(as $\lambda
  i^{\texttt{{Nat}}}.\cdots$ in the example above) for constructing (or
  introducing) term-indexed kinds (rule~$(\lambda i)$ in
  \Fig{FiTyping}).  

\item 
  Term-index application~$F\{s\}$ (as $X\{{\tt Z}\}$, $X\{j\}$, and
  $X\{\texttt{S}\;j\}$ in the example above) for destructing (or
  eliminating) term-indexed kinds, where the compile-time nature of
  indexing will be reflected in the typing rules, enforceing that the index be
  statically typed% in that it does not depend on run-time parameters
~(rule~$(@i)$ in \Fig{FiTyping}) .

\item 
  Term-index polymorphism~$\forall i^A.B$ (as $\forall
  j^{\texttt{{Nat}}}.\cdots$ in the example above) where the compile-time
  nature of polymorphic term-indexing will be reflected in the typing rules enforcing
  that the variable~$i$ be static of closed type~$A$~(rule~$(\forall
  Ii)$ in \Fig{FiTyping}).
\end{enumerate}

As described above, System~\Fi\ maintains a clear-cut separation between
type-indexing and term-indexing.  This adds a level of abstraction
to System~\Fw\ and yields types that in addition to parametric polymorphism
also keep track of inductive invariants using term-indices. All term-index
information can be erased, since it is only used at compile-time.  
It is possible to project any well-typed System~\Fi\ term into a well-typed System~\Fw\ term.
For instance, the erasure of the \Fi-type~\texttt{Vec}
is the \Fw-type~\texttt{List}.  This is established in
\S\ref{sec:theory} and used to deduce the strong normalization of
System~\Fi.
