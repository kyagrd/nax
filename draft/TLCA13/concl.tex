\section{Summary and Ongoing Work} \label{sec:concl}
System~\Fi\ is a strongly-normalizing, logically-consistent, higher-order
polymorphic lambda calculus that was designed to support the
definition of datatypes indexed by both terms and types.
In terms of expressivity, System~\Fi\ sits between System~\Fw\ and ICC.
We designed System~\Fi\ as a tool to reason about programming
languages with term-indexed datatypes. System \Fi\ can express
a large class of term-indexed datatypes, including datatypes with nested term
indices.

One limitation of System \Fi\ is that it cannot express type level
data structures such as lists that contain type elements.
We hope to overcome this limitation by extending System \Fi\ 
with first-class type representations \cite{DagMcb12}, which reflect
types as term level data (a sort of fully reflective version of
{\small\tt TypeRep} from Section \ref{intro}).

Our goal is to to build a unified programming and reasoning system,
which supports
(1) an expressive class of datatypes including nested term-indexed datatypes
and negative datatypes,
(2) logically consistent reasoning about program properties, and
(3) Hindley--Milner-style type inference.
Towards this goal, we are developing the programming language Nax \cite{AhnSheFioPit12},
which is based on System \Fi. Nax is given semantics in terms of System~\Fi.
That is, all the primitive language constructs of Nax that are not present
in \Fi\ have translations into System \Fi. Such constructs include
Mendler-style recursion combinators, recursive type operator, and
pattern matching.

Some language features we want to include in Nax go beyond \Fi.
There are recursion schemes that guarantee normalization due to paradigmatic use
of indices in datatypes. For instance, some recursive computations always
reduce a natural number term-index in every recursive call.
Although we know that such computations obviously terminate, we cannot express
them in System \Fi, since term-indices in \Fi\ are erasable -- \Fi\ only
accepts terms that are already type-correct in \Fw.
We plan to explore extensions to \Fi\ that enable such computations
while maintailing logical consistency.
