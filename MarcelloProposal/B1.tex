\subsection{Proposal}
\label{Proposal}

\paragraph*{General aim.}

Headed by Principal Investigator Marcelo Fiore, {\erc} assembles an
international team of world-leading experts in theoretical and applied
computer science.  The project builds a group of researchers
dedicated to combined research in Category Theory, Mathematical Logic,
Programming Theory, and Type Theory.  Specifically, to understand and develop
formal languages and mathematical models for computer programming and
mathematical proof. 

\paragraph*{Working thesis.}

The research is driven by the thesis that
\begin{myquote}
\item
Languages 
for computer programming
and languages 
for mathematical proof 
are of the same character.
\end{myquote}
This view %conception 
%%is of course not original to us.  It 
was first developed in the 1960s %, with proponents from computer science
%(\eg~McCarthy, Dijkstra, Hoare, Strachey) and from mathematics (\eg~de Bruijn,
%Scott, Martin-L\"of); 
and is now central to research in programming languages and constructive
mathematics.

An aspect of the thesis that is fundamental to us here is usually referred
to as the Proofs-as-Programs or Propositions-as-Types correspondence.
%There is an aspect of the thesis that is rooted in the constructive
%approach to mathematical practice and is fundamental to us here.  This 
It can be impressionistically %roughly 
presented %as a correspondence 
as follows
\[%\begin{equation}\label{PATproportion}%\xymatrix@C5pt{
%  \frac{\txt{program}}{\txt{Type}} 
%  & \mbox{\Large$\approx$} & 
%  \frac{\txt{proof}}{\txt{Proposition}}
%}
%
  \mbox{proof : Proposition} 
  \enspace \approx \enspace 
  \mbox{program : Type} 
%\end{equation}
\]
One %and one
intuitively explains the correspondence along these lines: %the lines below:
%\begin{myitemize} 
%\item 
  to give a constructive proof of a proposition 
  %(\eg~that every number is smaller than a prime number) 
  is to construct a program that certifies the statement, 
  %(\eg~one that on inputing a number, outputs some prime number bigger
  %than it);
  while
%\item 
  to type a program is to establish a property of that program.
  %(\eg~that certain input/output behaviour or invariant is maintained). 
%\end{myitemize} 

Research stemming from the Propositions-as-Types correspondence has been
very fruitful.  Many of its mathematical theories have been implemented as
computer systems, and used academically and industrially.  Cases in point
are: programming languages for high-assurance code and proof assistants
for computer-aided verification; examples of which are
Haskell, %~\cite{Haskell} 
an industrial-strength functional programming language, 
and Coq, %~\cite{Coq} 
a proof assistant in which bodies of mathematics are being verified.

\paragraph*{The future.}

Transferring mathematical theories to computer
systems has required both technical/theoretical and technological/applied
progress.  This has necessarily demanded increasingly specialised, and to
some extent fragmentary, research.  
Importantly, %though, 
the field has reached a first plateau; encompassing a substantial body of
work and expertise.  
How %But, how
will it continue to advance?  
By considering new directions and challenges, of course.  
But, 
it is our firm view that %, as in the early days of the subject, 
it will be essential to do so generating questions and tackling problems
from the perspectives of a variety of research areas.  
It is both of these aspects that we put forward here.

\paragraph*{Our philosophy.}

Two disciplines are clearly involved in investigating the
Proofs-as-Programs 
correspondence: %~(\ref{PATproportion}) above:
Mathematical Logic and Programming Theory.  
%Much research, as the one proposed here, is geared towards finding a middle
%ground that can accommodate the concerns of both, and expand their 
%realms. %domains.
%
This %However, this 
is only half of the picture.  The full 
picture also involves the disciplines of Type Theory and Category
Theory.  
%Their role is to enrich~(\ref{PATproportion}) as follows

gives a schematic view of the interactions between these four research areas
in this context.  Each of them is complementary to the others.  Together, as a
unified whole, they have shaped fields of computer science and mathematics.  
\hide{
Indeed, consider for instance that: 
\begin{myitemize}
\item
  the categorical interpretation of quantifiers as
  adjoints~\cite{LawvereAinF} informed the development of the
  type-theoretic dependent sums and dependent products~\cite{ScottCV};
\item
  type theories are the foundation of programming-language typing
  systems~\cite{Pierce};
\item
  the control operators of programming languages are key to the
  constructive interpretation of classical proofs~\cite{Griffin}; and 
\item
  model-theoretic studies of the polymorphic lambda
  calculus~\cite{GirardSystemF,Reynolds} led to remarkable small complete
  categories~\cite{Hyland}.
\end{myitemize}
}
%
It is within this framework that we propose cross-cutting research in Category
Theory, Mathematical Logic, Programming Theory, and Type Theory.  
We %Furthermore, we 
contend that an approach neglecting any one of them is to the detriment of
the others; missing the depth and richness of the subject and, crucially,
missing opportunities for research and development.  

\paragraph*{Main goals.}

The motivations for our research proposal are specifically as follows. 
\begin{myitemize}
\item[\raisebox{.75mm}{\tiny$\bigstar$}]\hspace*{-2mm}
  To search for %elucidate 
  %what we hope to be 
  the next-generation framework of Type Theory
  relevant to computer science and mathematics.
\item[\raisebox{.75mm}{\tiny$\bigstar$}]\hspace*{-2mm}
  To exercise and test Category Theory both as a unifying and as a
  foundational mathematical language.
\item[\raisebox{.75mm}{\tiny$\bigstar$}]\hspace*{-2mm}
  To broaden the current role of Mathematical Logic in computation.
\item[\raisebox{.75mm}{\tiny$\bigstar$}]\hspace*{-2mm}
  %To develop Programming Theory, designing, implementing, and experimenting
  %with languages of the future.
  To design, implement, and experiment within Programming Theory, looking
  into the languages of the future.
\end{myitemize}

We particularly aim to contribute with: a framework to analyse and synthesise
type theories; mathematical theories and models for computational phenomena;
formal calculi for proof and/or computation; and experimental high-level
programming languages.

\paragraph*{Research programme.}

The research programme has been precisely conceived to target the goals
above.  It is organised in four strands as outlined below.
\begin{myitemize}
\item[{\bfseries 1\enspace Foundations:}]\mbox{}\enspace\thinspace 
  \emph{A comprehensive research programme on the metamathematics of type
    theories.}
  %--- addressing the problem of what type theories are.

  \vspace*{1mm}
  We will address the fundamental question of what type theories are,
  which will also lead us to rethink them.  
  Our approach 
  %is novel and ambitious.  It 
  aims at an algebraic framework that will generalise to type theories all
  aspects of our current understanding of algebraic
  theories. %, from the perspectives of categorical algebra,
  %equational logic, and universal algebra. 
  %%(see the Algebraic Trinity of Figure~\ref{} on page~\pageref{}).  
  The scale at which we will be attempting this is unprecedented,
  systematically exploring a wide spectrum of key type-theoretic features.
  \vspace*{1mm}

\item[{\bfseries 2\enspace Models:}]\mbox{}\enspace\thinspace
  \emph{Study of mathematical models for type theories and logical systems.}
  %--- targeting semantic problems at the forefront of current understanding. 

  \vspace*{1mm}
  We will tackle semantic problems at the forefront of current understanding.
  %
  In the context of type theories, we will conduct investigations
  concerning a main problem in the area: to reconcile extensional equality
  and intensional identity (which, roughly, respectively correspond to the
  mathematical and computational notions of sameness).  
  %
  In the context of logical systems, we will develop both %novel 
  calculi suggested by mathematical models and %new 
  models for so far intractable calculi, encompassing aspects of resource
  management and computational effects.  
  %A distinguishing novelty of our approach is that it will be informed by the
  %logical notion of polarisation.
  \vspace*{-3mm}%%%HACK!!!
  
\item[{\bfseries 3\enspace Calculi:}]\mbox{}\enspace\thinspace
  \emph{Development of formalisms of deduction as internal languages of
    mathematical models.}
  %--- researching type theories that go beyond current logical frameworks. 
  
  \vspace*{1mm}
  We will aim at evolving the term and type structure of current type
  theories, which in essence has not changed since the late 1960s.  Pursuing
  the view that further evolution will come from mathematical input, we will
  research type theories as formal languages of (higher-dimensional)
  categorical structures.  
  \vspace*{1mm}

\item[{\bfseries 4\enspace Programming:}]\mbox{}\enspace\thinspace
  \emph{Design and implementation of novel computational languages.}
  %--- %looking into the 
  %engineering %of first 
  %principles and concepts from mathematical theories.

  \vspace*{1mm}
  Guided by mathematical theories and pragmatics, we will look into the
  engineering of principles and concepts for programming, exporting them to
  language designs and implementations.  We will specifically consider
  experimental languages, supporting indexed data structures, computational
  effects, and metaprogramming.  
\end{myitemize}

\paragraph*{The team.}

The team to pursue the research programme will be led by 
%\begin{myitemize}
%  \item 
    Principal Investigator~(PI) \emph{Marcelo Fiore} 
    (Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge): 
    a %world-
    leading expert in applications of category theory to computer science,
    including abstract algebra, concurrency theory, programming-language
    semantics, sheaf theory, and type theory.  
%\end{myitemize}
%
He will be 
backed up %supported 
by an international group of three Senior Visiting Researchers~(SVRs):
%(that are to visit the PI for one month per year): 
%\begin{myitemize}
%\item 
  \emph{Pierre-Louis Curien} 
  (Laboratoire PPS, Univerist\'e Paris Diderot - Paris~7): 
  a %world-
  leading expert in programming-language semantics, with contributions
  into category theory, logic, %rewriting theory, 
  and type theory; 
%\item
  \emph{Peter Dybjer} 
  (Department of Computer Science, Chalmers University of Technology): 
  a %world-
  leading expert in type theory, including its connections with category
  theory and logic, and its implementation in proof assistants; and 
%\item
  \emph{Tim Sheard} 
  (Department of Computer Science, Portland State University): 
  a %world-
  leading expert in pro\-gram\-ming-language design and implementation,
  encompassing functional and metaprogramming systems. 
%\end{myitemize}
%
The PI is to collaborate with the SVRs by mutual research visits, email, and
conference calls.
%
The team is completed by three outstanding Research Associates~(RAs) to be
based at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, under the PI.  They
are
%\begin{myitemize}
%\item
  \emph{Ki Yung Ahn}
  (Department of Computer Science, Portland State University): 
  a PhD student of %Tim 
  Sheard currently writing up his dissertation on the design and
  implementation of a language for indexed programming;
%\item
  \emph{Nicola Gambino}
  (Dipartimento di Matematica e Informatica, Universit\`a degli Studi di
  Palermo):  
  an established researcher in the areas of type theory and category theory,
  with whom the PI has already collaborated; and 
%\item
  \emph{Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni}
  (Laboratoire PPS, Univerist\'e Paris Diderot - Paris~7): 
  a PhD student of %Pierre-Louis 
  Curien writing up his dissertation on the Propositions-as-Types
  correspondence in the context of classical logic.
%\end{myitemize}
Currently, the two junior RAs lack future funding.  All RAs would be ready
to join the project from the start.

}

\paragraph*{Logic and computation.}

%It is worth recalling that 
Computer science was born as a branch of mathematics, specifically
mathematical logic. %, even before the first electronic computers were built.
Its inception %The inception of computer science 
was Hilbert's %~\cite{?}
%1928 
Decision Problem, %Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem),
asking whether there is an algorithmic procedure for deciding mathematical
statements.  Negative answers were provided independently by
Church~\cite{Church1936} 
%in 1936 
and 
Turing~\cite{Turing},
%in 1937,
giving birth to the mathematical theory of computation.  Their 
%completely different 
approaches gave rise to different branches of theoretical
computer science. %that still persist today.  
The line of development starting with Church's {\lcalculus} %~\cite{?} 
is concerned with prototypical computational languages that are
used to study high-level programming languages.  
%On the other hand, Turing's machines %~\cite{?} 
%are the most widely 
%used model for analysing computational complexity.
%
This %Church's 
view is central to this proposal.  
\hide{
The {\lcalculus} is a
deceptively simple formal system.  Its syntax consists of three types of
phrases: variables, applications, and abstraction.  Church's seminal
innovation was in introducing the latter one, 
%the other two being already familiar form the realm of
%algebra~\cite{Birkhoff}, 
which in modern terminology is referred to as a binding operator, a notion
that goes beyond the operators of universal algebra. %~\cite{Birkhoff}.
Binding operators are an integral part of all high-level programming
languages.  
%Their mathematical theory is subtle %, see~\ref{}, 
%because they define syntax up to the consistent renaming of bound
%variables (technically referred to as \mbox{$\alpha$-equivalence}).
%This subtlety is made evident by the anecdotal fact that the first definitions
%of substitution were formally flawed.  
%%These important topics are core to our proposed research in
%%Section\pref{AlgebraicTypeTheoryParagraph}.
}

%Incidentally, the notion of variable binding was initially introduced much
%earlier, by Frege~\cite{Frege1879}, in the context of mathematical logic.  
%He used binders to define a formal symbolic
%system axiomatising not only the propositional connectives of Boolean
%logic~\cite{Boole} but also, for the first time, the quantifiers of
%predicate logic.

%The %In modern notation, the 
%{\lcalculus} syntax is given by
%  \[\begin{array}{rcll}
%    s , t & ::= & & \mbox{($\lambda$-terms)}\\
%      & \mid & x & \quad\mbox{(variables)}\\
%      & \mid & (t)s & \quad\mbox{(application)}\\
%      & \mid & \lambda x.\,t & \quad\mbox{(abstraction)}
%  \end{array}\]
%The system has only one rule of computation:
%  \begin{equation}\label{BetaReduction}\begin{array}{rl}
%(\beta) & (\lambda x.\,t)s \,\longrightarrow\, t[s/x]
%  \end{array}\end{equation}

\hide{
The concept of `type' was conceived to solve a foundational
problem.  In 1903, %~\cite{Frege1903}, building on~\cite{Frege1879}, 
Frege proposed
a logical system as a foundation for mathematics.
%including arithmetic.  
In his now famous paradox, 
Russell %~\cite{Russell1902}
observed that one of Frege's axioms led to inconsistency.  
%He was led to this contradiction by related contradictions he found while
%developing his account of set theory.  
To overcome such foundational problems, 
he %Russell 
introduced the `doctrine of types'. 
% --- typed systems can avoid these inconsistencies.
}

Type Theory, as we now know it, 
arose from the integration by Church
of types into his \lcalculus, yielding the %so-called 
Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus. %~\cite{Church1940}.  
This was a natural step, particularly if one held the naive interpretation of
\mbox{$\lambda$-abstraction} as defining functions.  
%The type theory known as the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus has a set of types
%consisting of basic ones
%closed under a function-type constructor. %:
%\[\begin{array}{rcll}
%    \sigma,\tau & ::= & & \mbox{(simple types)}\\
%    & \mid & \theta & \quad\mbox{(basic types)}\\
%    & \mid & \sigma\to\tau & \quad\mbox{(function types)}
%  \end{array}\]
%In the Simply-Typed Lambda
%Calculus, \mbox{$\lambda$-terms}~$t$ are classified by types~$\tau$, in
%contexts $\Gamma$ (assigning types to variables), for which the notation
%$\Gamma\vdash t:\tau$
%is commonly used.  This is done according to syntax-directed rules. 
% that in the mathematical vernacular are presented as follows
%  \[
%  \begin{array}{c}
%    \\ \hline
%    x_1:\tau_1,\ldots,x_n:\tau_n\vdash x_i:\tau_i
%  \end{array}
%  \enspace(1\leq i\leq n)

%  \[\begin{array}{c}
%    \Gamma\vdash t:\sigma\to\tau

In this context, a fundamental discovery relating Mathematical Logic to Type
Theory was made %by Curry and 
by Howard~\cite{Howard1969}.

%contexts (technically, Hilbert-style deduction %~\cite{Hilbert}

%For the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus, the correspondence

%the typing rules (given above) 
%yields the deduction rules
%\[\begin{array}{c}
%  \begin{array}{c}

%of Intuitionistic %Minimal 
%Logic. %~\cite{?}.

In another very important direction Church introduced a Simple Theory of
Types~\cite{Church1940} 
as an axiomatization of Higher-Order Logic.
This axiomatization was formalised within a Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus.
%with basic types for both individuals and propositions, further enriched with
%constants for the logical connectives.  
In doing so, he adopted a radically new perspective, shifting the status
of the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus from that of a `language' to a
`metalanguage'. %;~\ie, a language in which it is possible to represent and
%work with other languages. 
%In this particular case for simple type theories.  
\hide{
  When regarded as a metalanguage, the Simply-Typed
Lambda Calculus is considered as an equational theory. %, with the
%computational \mbox{$\beta$-rule}~(\ref{BetaReduction}) stated as an
%equation together with the extensionality equation

%& \mbox{, where $x$ is not free in $t$}

The processes of abstracting from languages to metalanguages has become a
common activity in computer science, and plays an important role in our
proposed investigations.

\paragraph*{Category theory, logic, and type theory.}

\hide{
The theory of categories was introduced by Eilenberg and Mac
Lane~\cite{EilenbergMacLane}.  A category is a mathematical structure
consisting of objects and morphisms.  Morphisms are classified
by pairs of objects. The notation $f:A\to B$ stipulates that $A$ and $B$ are
objects, and that $f$ is a morphism with domain $A$ and codomain~$B$.  
Categories come equipped with an associative law that composes pairs of
morphisms 
%as on the left below
%\begin{equation}\label{Category}
%  \begin{array}{c}
%  f:A\to B\quad g:B\to C
%  \\ \hline
%  g\,f:A\to C
%\end{array}
%\quad\qquad
%1_A:A\to A
%\end{equation}
together with, for every object, an identity morphism 
%as on the right above
that is a neutral element for composition.  
%Categories were defined to introduce functors, a notion of morphism between
%categories, which in turn was defined to introduce natural transformations, a
%notion of morphism between functors.

In understanding categories, it is helpful to have in mind
that they have two kinds of uses: in the
large and in the small.  In the large, categories are seen as mathematical
universes of discourse (within which mathematical constructions take place,
typically by means of universal properties); like the categories of: sets and
functions, algebraic structures and homomorphisms, spaces and continuous
functions.  In the small, categories are seen as mathematical objects
themselves; like a set, a monoid, a preorder, and a graph, all of which can
be suitably regarded as a category.
}

\hide{
Category Theory analyses mathematical structure by isolating the principles
for which mathematical theories work.  
}
%Because of this attention to essentials, it has had considerable success
%in unifying ideas from many areas of mathematics. 
%Today it an indispensable tool in abstract algebra, algebraic geometry,
%mathematical logic, mathematical physics, topology, and theoretical computer
%science, as well as a growing research area in its own right.

The connection between Category Theory, Logic, and Type Theory was
initiated by Lawvere %~\cite{LawvereAinF} 
and Lambek. %~\cite{LambekI}, 
%both
%of whom recognised logical systems and type theories as categories with
%structure.  
%Here we are concerned with the former, postponing the latter to the following
%section.
%
Lawvere's insight was to understand logical connectives and type
constructors as categorical structures arising from 
%universal properties in the form of 
adjoint functors. %, a notion introduced by Kan~\cite{Kan}
%motivated by homology theory.  
%For instance, the categories with structure corresponding to the Simply-Typed
%Lambda Calculus with products are Cartesian Closed Categories.  These have
%categorical products and exponentials 
%, respectively denoted $\times$ and $\Rightarrow$, 
%defined by adjoint situations.
%establishing natural bijective correspondences between
%morphisms as follows:
%  \[
%  \begin{array}{c}
%    C\to A \enspace,\enspace C\to B
%    \\ \hline\hline
%    C\to (A\times B)
%  \end{array}
%  \quad\qquad
%  \begin{array}{c}
%    (C\times A)\to B
%    \\ \hline\hline
%    C\to (A\Rightarrow B)
%  \end{array}
%\]
%The required naturality condition amounts to the computational $\beta$
%laws and the extensionality $\eta$ laws.
%
It
%The similarity between the bijective correspondence on the right above and the
%typing rule for \mbox{$\lambda$-abstraction}~(\ref{LambdaAbstraction}) is not
%casual, and it 
is now well-understood that the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus with products
provides an internal language for Cartesian Closed Categories: %; namely, 
it is the calculus of all such models.  This view further enriches the
Propositions-as-Types correspondence as 
%in the trinity below %in Figure\,\ref{PAT}.

\paragraph*{Type theory and programming.}

The Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus 
%, regarded as a language rather than as a metalanguage, 
is a prototypical functional programming language.  
%The change of perspective from Type Theory to Programming Theory is not
%straightforward and comes with considerations that enrich both subjects.  
%
In %the context of programming languages, 
this light, %Milner %~\cite{Milner1978}

%type discipline, %to classify programs according to their type invariants,
%programmers would be better served if type annotations were inferred.
%automatically.  
%
the %The 
problem of type inference 
%(by which given a program one wishes to compute the
%best possible type for it) is %became 
of central practical importance.  
%For
%Combinatory Logic %\footnote{Combinatory Logic is an important symbolic
%  formalism introduced by Sch\"onfinkel~\cite{Schonfinkel} closely related
%  to the {\lcalculus}, but based on algebraic combinators, that enjoys the
%  Propositions-as-Types correspondence with respect to the Hilbert-style
%  deduction system for Intuitionistic %Minimal 
%  Logic.} 
%this problem was solved by Hindley. %~\cite{Hindley1969}.  
%Independently, 
Milner~\cite{Milner1978} 
solved it %in a context more relevant to programming; namely, 
for the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus with parametric polymorphism.  
%The algorithm is known as the Hindley-Milner type inference method.  
%The approach is very robust. 
%, extending broadly to many related systems.
 
Polymorphism in programming %refers to languages that support abstraction
%mechanisms by which a program %(function or procedure) 
%can be used with a variety of types.  The concept 
was introduced by Strachey~\cite{Strachey1967}.
%who further classified the phenomena into ad-hoc polymorphism and parametric
%polymorphism.  The former is also referred to as overloading and accounts for
%uses of a program with different types (like integers and reals) by means of
%different algorithms.  The latter indicates the use of a uniform program for
%all types (like a duplicator program making copies of its input).
%
Reynolds~\cite{Reynolds} 
formalised 
it %the programming intuition 
by introducing the Polymorphic Typed Lambda Calculus. 
%; an extension of the Simply-Typed Lambda
%Calculus with polymorphic types.  
%Roughly, these are abstract parametric types
%whose programs can be used for all instances of the parameter.  
Strikingly,
this system 
had already been proposed %several years earlier 
by
Girard~\cite{GirardSystemF} 
%under the name of {\SystemF}, 
as the
type-theoretic counterpart of Second-Order Propositional Logic. 
%in the context of the Propositions-as-Types correspondence.  
%Further, 
Girard had
also introduced {\SystemFomega}, the type-theoretic counterpart of
Higher-Order Propositional Logic.  
%These logical systems widely extend the
%expressiveness of the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus, notably by the
%possibility of encoding inductive data types. %~\cite{BoehmBerarducci}.
{\SystemFomega} lies at the core of the Haskell programming
language. %~\cite{EqProofICFP12}.

These %The above

%In this direction,

Scott~\cite{ScottTCS}

and enriched type theory with concerns from programming: the distinction
between call-by-value and call-by-name~\cite{PlotkinCBVCBN}.

\label{LogicalWiringSubsection}

Lambek~\cite{LambekI} recognised the similarity between the basic
structure of a category, given by identities and
composition~(see\pref{Category}), and the wiring of logical deduction
systems, specifically Gentzen's sequent calculi~\cite{Gentzen1935}, given
by the axiom and cut rules.  Intuitionistic sequents led
Lambek~\cite{LambekII} to axiomatize their algebra under the concept of
multicategory.  This correspondence is roughly as outlined below (where the
vector notation $\vec{\,\cdot\,}$ stands for finite sequences of objects):

The analogous for classical sequents was done by Szabo~\cite{Szabo} with the
introduction of polycategories.

The structure of multicategory appeared independently in a very different
mathematical context, the work of May~\cite{May} on homotopical algebra, under
the name of Operad.  Operads are now central to studies in higher-dimensional
algebra (see~\eg~\cite{Leinster,LodayVallette}).

%The importance of this passage is that the kind of variation embodied in the

%
%The presheaf construction was introduced by Grothendieck together with a

\paragraph*{Resources, effects, modalities.}
\label{ResourcesEffectsModalitiesParagraph}

Girard~\cite{GirardLinearLogic} and Moggi~\cite{MoggiLambdaC} propose two
important analyses of computation, respectively for resources and effects.
The former in the contexts of logic and proof theory; the latter in that
of denotational semantics and category theory.  
%Both %, however, have 
%had tremendous impact in programming-language theory.  
%%The resource analysis in the form of Linear Logic calculi; the effect
%%analysis in the form of Computational \mbox{$\lambda$-calculi}.

\hide{
From the viewpoint of categorical models, the resource and effect management
structures are respectively seen as comonadic and monadic structures.
Comonads and monads being dual categorical concepts that arose in the context
of cohomology theory in the 1960s~\cite{BeckThesis}.

A classical basic result of category theory establishes a strong
correspondence between (co)monads and adjoint functors
(see~\eg~\cite{MacLane}).  One aspect of this is that every adjunction
  \begin{equation}\label{ResourceEffectAdjunction}
  \xymatrix@C=40pt{
    \cat D \ar@/^.75em/[r]|(.625){\mbox{$\,G\,$}}\ar@{}[r]|-\swvdash&
    \ar@/^.75em/[l]|(.625){\mbox{$\,F\,$}} \cat C }
\end{equation}
with $F$ and $G$ respectively left and right adjoint to each other, gives
rise (by composition) to a comonad on $\cat D$ and a monad on $\cat C$.  This
viewpoint gave impetus to further analyses based on the more primitive notion
of adjunction.  

Models of Linear Logic are founded on the theory of
monoidal categories~\cite[Chapter~VII.1]{MacLane}.  For them, one requests
that the adjunction be monoidal with respect to linear structure on $\cat D$
and cartesian (or multiplicative) structure on $\cat C$
(see~\eg~\cite{MelliesCMLL}).  On the other hand, models of Computational
\mbox{$\lambda$-calculi} rely on enriched category theory~\cite{KellyBook}.
Here, the structure is roughly given by an enriched adjunction with $\cat C$
cartesian and $\cat D$ with powers (or exponentials) relative to $\cat C$.
}

\hide{

modal operators, and some of the literature has indeed considered them as
such.  %(see \eg~\cite{Kobayashi}).  %BiermanDePaiva
The field of modal logics is broad, with many subfields of specialised logics
motivated by computation, linguistics, and philosophy.  While a class of modal
logics known as temporal logics have played a prominent role, and been very
successful, in the area of computer aided verification; the impact of modal
logics on programming languages has been peripheral.  It is thus natural and
important to reconsider them in this context.

The main novel features of the formalism~\SysL, and its philosophy, are an

\paragraph{Algebraic Type Theory.}
\label{AlgebraicTypeTheoryParagraph}

\hide{
To understand our approach it is best to start by stripping type theories
down to their essential bare structure.  To do so, let us eliminate type
constructors and binding operators from them.  What one is left with is a
notion of type theory that reduces to that of many-sorted algebraic
theory~\cite{Birkhoff}, a thoroughly studied area of abstract algebra.
}

Many-sorted algebra provides the most basic notion of type theory, with no
binding operators and no type constructors.  Its modern understanding is
through an Algebraic Trinity of three interrelated perspectives:
%as in the Algebraic Trinity of Figure\,\ref{AlgebraicTrinity}.

%\end{figure}
Equational Logic, Categorical Algebra, and Universal Algebra
(see~\cite{Birkhoff,LawvereThesis,Linton}).
%Equational Logic is the metalanguage of algebraic theories, while
%Universal Algebra is its model theory.  They were both introduced by
%Birkhoff~\cite{Birkhoff}, with the former as a by-product of the latter
%related by a soundness and completeness theorem.  The categorical
%viewpoint of algebraic theories came later, with the work of
%Lawvere~\cite{LawvereThesis} and Linton~\cite{Linton}.  Two crucial
%categorical structures that play a pivotal role here are: Lawvere
%theories~(closely related to Hall's abstract clones) and finitary
%monads~(a notion 
%%originally introduced in cohomology theory by Beck~\cite{Check???}, 
%arising in algebra from free constructions).
%
%Each of the approaches to algebraic theories in the Algebraic Trinity gives a
%different viewpoint of the subject.  Thus, it is important to consider them
%all.  
Each of these approaches %to algebraic theories 
gives a different viewpoint of the subject, and is thus important to consider
them all.  
%
\hide{For instance, Equational Logic provides the deductive system for formal
reasoning about equations from axioms; Universal Algebra provides a general
notion of model from which one derives an abstract notion of syntactic
structure by means of freely generated models; Categorical Algebra provides an
invariant notion of theory together with a notion of translation between them
that lifts to adjoint functors between categories of models.}

\hide{
Having deconstructed type theories down to many-sorted algebraic theories:
Can one reconstruct them back, and in the process enrich them, as a unified
mathematical theory encompassing all aspects of the Algebraic Trinity?  This
is the main general goal of this research track.
}

We will pursue an analogous development for varieties of Type Theory.
%
To make substantial progress, %in the area, 
we will systematically explore a broad spectrum of key features present in
type theories; to wit, term and type variable binding with simple,
polymorphic, and dependent typing, in combination with the orthogonal notion
of linearity.

\paragraph{Wiring structure.}
\label{WiringStructureParagraph}

A basic concern in the investigation of
Section\pref{AlgebraicTypeTheoryParagraph} is the
understanding of the mathematical structure of sequents and judgements.
This subject has already received attention, but new perspectives are emerging
that call for its reconsideration.

Remitting ourselves back to Section\pref{LogicalWiringSubsection}, the
first thing to notice is that there are two possible axiomatizations for
multicategory composition: the one exhibited there, known as partial
composition, and a total (or simultaneous) one of the form
{\small\begin{equation}\label{TotalComposition}\begin{array}{c}
  g: A_1,\ldots,A_n \to B
  \\[1mm]
  f_i:\vec{X_i}\to A_i\enspace(1\leq i\leq n)
  \\[.75mm] \hline\\[-2.5mm]
    g\circ(f_1,\ldots,f_n):\vec{X_1},\ldots,\vec{X_n}\to B
\end{array}\end{equation}}%
In the presence of identities, both notions are equivalent.  An interesting
observation from the theory of operads is that this is not so
otherwise~\cite{Markl}.

The %Algebraically, the 
total composition structure~(\ref{TotalComposition}) is well understood
(see~\eg~\cite{FioreFossacs}).
%as given by semigroup structure (technically in the category of Joyal Linear
%Species~\cite{JoyalAdvMath} with respect to the substitution tensor
%product~\cite{KellyOperads,JoyalLNM1234}).  
But, what about the concept of partial composition?  That, after all, is the
predominant in logic and type theory.  For it, Fiore has recently uncovered an
unexpected connection with structure stemming from the mathematical theory of
\emph{Lie algebras}. %~\cite{LieRef}. 
%; specifically, the pre-Lie algebra structure of
%Gerstenhaber~\cite{Gerstenhaber}.  Furthermore, and analogous, though more
%interesting situation occurs with polycategories~\cite{Szabo} and the
%Lie-admissible algebraic structure of Albert~\cite{Albert}.
%
%We regard these observations as the starting point for interactions between
%operad theory and logic and type theory for pursuing research as follows.
%
This is the starting point for research on
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{0}
\item
  New interactions between abstract algebra, and proof and type theory.
\end{resenumerate}
Specifically, 
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{1}
\item 
  There is a rich variety of algebraic structures with notions of composition,
  \eg~motivated by studies in combinatorics, geometry, physics.  What do they,
  and their mathematical theory, transfer to in proof and type theory?  
  
\item 
  Conversely, the binding operators of logic and type theory introduce
  algebraic structure of a kind so far unseen in mathematics.  This enriches
  the theory and is worth investigating.

From operad theory to logic and type theory:

    Kontsevitch introduced the notion of a meager PROP (renamed
    as \raisebox{.75mm}{\scriptsize$\frac 1 2$}PROP by
    Markl~\cite{Markl}) sitting in between that of operad and
    polycategory.  Is there any use for these in logic and type theory?

  \item
    What about other generalisations, like the preshuffle algebras of
    Ronco~\cite{RoncoShuffleBialgebras} and the permutads of Ronco and
    Loday~\cite{Permutads}?  In particular, the former embodies the
    algebra needed in computational contexts with effects, where the
    notion of total composition does not make sense, and the notion of
    partial composition is subject to weaker axioms to those of
    multicategory.  This is relevant to our proposed investigations in
Sections\,(\ref{PolarisationParagraph}\,\&\,\ref{ProgrammingEffectsParagraph}).

  \item
    There is a rich variety of notions of operads, and notions of
    composition between them, many of which are motivated by
    combinatorics.  What can they offer to logic and type theory?  This
    question is not as vacuous as it may seem at first sight.  For instance,
    the shuffle and quasi-shuffle composition (see~\eg~\cite{AguiarMahajan})
    seem to be related to a type theory for non-commutative linear logic of
    Polakow and Pfenning~\cite{NatDedForIntNonCommLinLog}.

From logic and type theory to operad theory:

  \item
    The new Lie-algebraic view of multicategory composition mentioned
    above gives a rational reconstruction of an explicit characterisation of
    the pre-Lie operad by Chapoton and Livernet~\cite{ChapotonLivernet}.  The
    case of polycategory composition leads to a conjectured characterisation
    for the Lie-admissible operad.  A possible approach to proving it leads to
    the introduction of new interesting algebraic structures.

  \item\label{BellantoniCook}
    A combination of the \emph{linearity} dimension of
    Figure\,\ref{TypeTheoryResearchSpace} with the other dimensions (that take
    place in the traditional \emph{cartesian} setting, where all structural
    rules on contexts are allowed) leads to a notion of mixed
    operad~\cite{FioreMFPS}, whose associated composition operation is new
    to the mathematical theory.

    Mixed operads are the wiring of linear/cartesian languages, which since
    the work of Bellantoni and Cook~\cite{BellantoniCook} play a role in
    implicit complexity theory.  It would be interesting to develop this
    connection.  A main aim would be to introduce new mathematical structure
    in implicit complexity theory that would help with its problems.  This is
    relevant to our proposed investigations in
    Section\pref{SubstructuralTypeTheoryParagraph}.

  \item
    The algebraic structure on operads considered in mathematics is in
    the tradition of linear algebra (\ie~first-order).  However, the binding
    operators of logic and type theory transport to operads as a new kind of
    algebraic structure which thereby enriches the theory and is worth
    investigating.

  framework.
%\end{resenumerate}
%Various aspects of what follows arose and are under discussion with Warren
%(IAS School of Mathematics, Princeton).
}

Central to a type theory is its associated equational theory, %.  Equational
%theories of dependent type theories may be specified in different (though
%typically equivalent) forms (see~\eg~\cite{Adams}).  For the purpose of our
%informal discussion here it will be enough to assume that they determine a
%congruence relation
%%\[
%%  \Gamma \vdash M_1 = M_2: A
%%\]
%%for valid judgements $\Gamma\vdash M_i:A$ ($i=1,2$), 
or %henceforth referred to as 
judgemental equality.
%
In Pure Intensional Type Theory, judgemental equality is generated by
%so-called $\beta$ 
rules of computation. 
%(recall Section\pref{SectionATypeTheoryAndLogicParagraph}).
%
Extensional Type Theory refers to extensions of Pure Intensional Type Theory
with extensionality features.  These may be given by weak rules of
extensionality or by a strong rule of reflection (of an intensional notion of
equality internal to the type theory as a judgemental equality).
\hide{
In their simplest form,
these consist of incorporating %so-called $\eta$ 
rules of extensionality 
%(recall Section\pref{SectionATypeTheoryAndLogicParagraph}) 
into judgemental equality.  Such extensions will be referred to here as Weak
Extensional Type Theory.
%
%Already for these basic kind of systems, 
%%Pure Intensional and Weak Extensional Type Theory, 
%our knowledge of the subject is limited. %poor.
%%
%For instance, %In particular, 
%the concrete mathematical models (as opposed to syntactic ones) of Pure
%Intensional Type Theory 
%%with dependent sums and products 
%that researchers work with (like groupoids, strict $\omega$-categories, and
%simplicial sets) interpret dependent sums and dependent products as adjoints
%and hence are necessarily models of Weak Extensional Type Theory.  A first
%question arises:
%\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{1}
%\item 
%  Are there natural mathematical models of Pure Intensional Type Theory?
%\end{resenumerate}
%In examining this one should also consider:
%\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{2}
%\item 
%  What is a model of Pure Intensional Type Theory?
%\end{resenumerate}
%In this respect, we note that the current categorical formalisms
%(see~\eg~\cite{Jacobs}) are not flexible enough (as they are either based on
%adjoint interpretations or on ad hoc variations thereof).  On the other hand,
%the approach of Dybjer on Internal Type Theory~\cite{DybjerITT} will provide
%models within Cartmell's Generalised Algebraic Theories~\cite{Cartmell}.
%Their relationship to developments in the Algebraic Type Theory of
%Section\pref{AlgebraicTypeTheoryParagraph} will be investigated.

%  \[
%  x:T,y:T\vdash\Id_T(x,y)\ \mbox{\small$\mathsf{type}$}
%\]
that %are meant to 
provide a notion of equality internal to the type theory.
%
In Strong Extensional Type Theory, %one requires that 
Identity Types completely internalise judgemental equality

%However, as extensionality lays at the core of mathematics and its practice,
%the quest for a computational framework in between Pure Intensional Type
%Theory and Strong Extensional Type Theory continues.
}

Conceptually, one may regard a type theory as a basic deduction system
extended with type constructors. 
%For instance, Martin-L\"of Type Theory embodies dependent sums and dependent
%products, as well as Identity Types, W~Types, and Universes~\cite{ProgMLTT}.
As such, a type theory is to be thought not just as a single universe of
discourse, but rather as a variety of universes of discourse. 
%, corresponding to the various possible restrictions.  
From this perspective, it is important to understand the interaction of
modularly extending type theories.  A key notion %in this respect 
is that of conservative extension.
Informally, an extension %$T'$ of $T$ is conservative if the restriction of the
%judgemental equality of $T'$ to $T$ coincides with the judgemental equality of
%$T$.
of a type theory is conservative when it does not modify the judgemental
equality of the extended type theory.
%
%Conservativity has been studied for some simple type 
%theories (see~\eg~\cite%[Section\,3]
%{FioreRemarks}), 
%but it has been overlooked for dependent type theories.

Research on the 
so far unexplored 
problem of conservativity in dependent type theory 
%, which has so far been overlooked, 
will be pursued.  We will aim at being comprehensive, targeting Intensional
and Weak/Strong Extensional type theories with
dependent sums, dependent products, inductive types, and universes.  Our
\emph{goal} is to deepen the current understanding of equality/extensionality
and identity/intensionality in type theory via a model-theoretic framework for
establishing conservative extension results.  

The full scientific proposal further expands on the above in connection to an
interesting recent approach to extensionality in Martin-L\"of Type Theory,
\viz~Voevodsky's Univalence Axiom~\cite{UnivalentProgramme}.

A recent interesting approach to extensionality being intensively
investigated is the extension by Voevodsky of Pure Intensional Type Theory
with a so-called Univalence Axiom %~\cite{UnivalenceAxiom} 
motivated by homotopical foundations.  This axiom has been shown consistent
from the outset.  We will furthermore tackle the but:

It is an open problem, referred to as Voevodsky's Main Computational
Conjecture, as to how to give a constructive interpretation of the Univalence
Axiom.  The question arises as to whether one could circumvent this problem by
concentrating instead on a notable consequence of the axiom; namely, that it
somehow endows Identity Types with logical character, very roughly in that the
Identity Type constructor logically commutes with all the other constructors
up to equivalence.  Therefore we will rather aim to:

\paragraph{Mathematical universes.}
\label{MethodologyMathematicalUniversesParagraph}

We speculate here on directions in relation to
Section\pref{MathematicalUniversesParagraph}, where we are interested in
building new models from old ones.  A main source of inspiration and
guidance for the development comes from Topos Theory~\cite{Elephant}.

Our proposal is to:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{0}
\item\label{ConstructionsOnTypeTheories}
  Investigate presheaf, orthogonality, sheaf, glueing, and forcing
  constructions on type theories.
\end{resenumerate}
with the general goal to:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{1}
\item
  Build a mathematical theory of constructions on type theories that
  produce new type theories from old ones, together with an interpretation
  (or compilation) of the latter into the former.
  
\item \label{MMUPAppItem}
  Implement the mathematics in proof assistants, and exercise it in
  applications.  
\end{resenumerate}

Initial work along this line has been done by Jaber, Tabareau, and
Sozeau~\cite{TypeTheoryWithForcing}, who formalised the presheaf
construction on a partial order in the Calculus of Constructions, and then
re-interpreted back the Calculus of Constructions in the internal presheaf
model.  However, not only a wide spectrum of other possible constructions
(as detailed in
item~\textbf{\ref{MethodologyMathematicalUniversesParagraph}}\thinspace\itemref{ConstructionsOnTypeTheories}
above) remains to be explored; but, even in this basic setting, work remains
to be done: notably to incorporate Inductive Types.

What we envisaged is also more general, in that we take the view that the
new type theory need not be of the same character as the old one.  Thus
there are two aspects to our proposed investigations: the mathematical one
of studying model constructions and the type-theoretic one of designing
internal languages.  To fix ideas, consider as an example that the
presheaf construction on a monoidal category endows the new universe of
discourse with monoidal closed structure (formally via Day's convolution
monoidal structure~\cite{Day}), and thereby introduces new linear structure.
This is important in many applications, for which the reader may
consult~\cite{FioreFossacs}, %, and complementary to our proposed
%investigations in Section\pref{SubstructuralTypeTheoryParagraph}.

The study of Cohen Forcing for type theory was stated as an open problem
by Beeson~\cite{BeesonBook}, who wrote: ``Forcing has yet to be worked out
directly for Martin-L\"of's system.''.  Work in this direction has only
recently begun.  Specifically, by Coquand and Jaber~\cite{CoquandNote} who
presented an interesting example.  Much remains to be explored both with
respect to the vast literature on set-theoretic forcing and, more
relevantly, with respect to Krivine's Classical
Realizability~\cite{KrivineRA}, an extension of forcing.

\paragraph{Polarised logic.}
\label{PolarisationParagraph}

We propose here a model-theoretic study of a rich variety of logical
systems encompassing aspects of resource management and computational
effects (recall Section\pref{ResourcesEffectsModalitiesParagraph}).  This
research is work under discussion with Curien and
Munch-Maccagnoni (Laboratoire~PPS, Universit\'e Paris Diderot - Paris~7).
A distinguishing novelty of our approach is that it will be pursued as
informed by the logical notion of polarisation.

The notion of explicit polarisation in logical systems was introduced by
Andreoli~\cite{Andreoli} in his study of proof search in Linear Logic, in
particular by focalisation.  According to it, logical connectives are
classified as either being positive or negative; with these two worlds
being dual to each other (categorically by adjunction).  Following
Andreoli's work, Girard understood the relevance of focalisation via
polarisation as a way to tame down the inherent non-determinism in
computation (by cut elimination) in classical logic; and, in this
direction, introduced the first explicitly polarised logic:
\LC~\cite{GirardLC}.  A crucial aspect of this system, is to make eager
(\viz~call-by-value) and lazy~(\viz,~call-by-name) modes of computation
explicit, allowing for their combination in a framework with eager and
lazy data structures.

Polarisation, though not recognised as such, is also present in the
Computational \mbox{$\lambda$-calculi} based on adjunction models as mentioned
in Section\pref{ResourcesEffectsModalitiesParagraph}.  This key
observation leads to a refinement of the
model~(\ref{ResourceEffectAdjunction}) as follows
  \begin{equation}\label{LCBPV}
  \begin{minipage}{\columnwidth}
  \xymatrix@R=5pt{
    & & 
    \\
    \ar@{}[u]|-{\text{\scriptsize(negative)}}
    \cat N \ar@/^.75em/[dr] & \ar@{}[rd]|-{\sevdash} \ar@{}[dl]|-{\swvdash} &
    \ar@/^.75em/[dl] \cat M \ar@{}[u]|-{\text{\scriptsize(multiplicative)}}\\
    & \ar@/^.75em/[lu] \cat P \ar@/^.75em/[ur]
    \ar@{}[d]|-{\txt{\scriptsize(positive/linear)}}& 
    \\ & & 
  }
\end{minipage}
\end{equation}
with comonadic resource structure given by the adjunction on the right and
monadic effect structure given by the adjunction on the left.

When the effect structure is trivial, the above restricts to models of Linear
Logic~\cite{MelliesCMLL}; while, when the resource structure is trivial, one
recovers the models of Call-By-Push-Value~\cite{LevyCBPV}.  One is thus led to
the following programme.
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{0}
\item\label{ItemOne}
  Devise a sound and complete logical system for the model
  theory~(\ref{LCBPV}), and relate it to existing polarised
  systems~\cite{Munch,CurienMunch}.
\item
  A first model-theoretic result shows that the effect structure on $\cat
  P$ lifts to one on $\cat M$.  Show that this corresponds to an encoding
  of Call-By-Push-Value in the devised logical system.
\item
  Develop a generic syntactic theory able to incorporate concrete
  computational effects into the devised calculus.  Two research possibilities
  are: (i)~considering algebraic theories of effects following the work of
  Plotkin and Power~\cite{PlotkinPowerAlgOpsAndGenEffs}, and
  (ii)~revisiting and refining Filinski's result on representing
  monads~\cite{Filinski} that reduces general monadic effects to the
  storage and escape effects.  
  \hide{Either of these approaches will necessarily
  have to overcome serious shortcomings.  For instance, on the one hand,
  there is as yet no general operational theory of algebraic effects; and,
  on the other, a logical system for storage is not yet in place.  These
  problems will be investigated.}
\item\label{ItemFour}
  The previous development will provide foundational metalanguages.  The
  next step in the programme is to promote them to programming languages,
  where the effects are implicit, by putting them in so-called
  direct-style.  The kind of model theory involved in this development
  will be discussed below.
\end{resenumerate}

The model theory of~(\ref{LCBPV}) can be further specialised to
models with enough internal structure so as to extend the picture as
follows
\begin{equation}\label{LEEC}
  \begin{minipage}{\columnwidth}
  \xymatrix@R=5pt{
    & \ar@/^.75em/[dl] \ar@{}[dl]|-\sevdash \cat N \ar@/^.75em/[dr] &
    \ar@{}[rd]|-{\sevdash} \ar@{}[dl]|-{\swvdash} & \ar@/^.75em/[dl] \cat
    M \\
    \ar@/^.75em/[ur] \cat P^\op & & \ar@/^.75em/[lu] \cat P \ar@/^.75em/[ur] & 
  }\end{minipage}
\end{equation}
where the new adjunction between the negatives and the opposite dual of
the positives enriches the models with control structure of the
linear %~\cite{ThieleckeEtAl} 
and/or delimited continuation %~\cite{PeytonJones?}
kind, though this is to be investigated.

The model theory~(\ref{LEEC}) refines that of two recent developments: the
aforementioned Enriched Effect Calculus, which amounts to the case in
which the linear structure collapses to cartesian one; and the Tensor
Logic of Melli\`es and Tabareau~\cite{TensorLogic}, where the effect
structure is collapsed.  Our programme for~(\ref{LCBPV}),
\ie~items~\mbox{\textbf{\ref{PolarisationParagraph}}\thinspace\textbf{[\ref{ItemOne}--\ref{ItemFour}]}},
will be then also pursued for~(\ref{LEEC}) drawing connections with these
works.

Let us now return to the distinction between metalanguages and programming
languages briefly mentioned in
item~\textbf{\ref{PolarisationParagraph}}\thinspace\itemref{ItemFour} above.
Model theoretically, this can be roughly seen as follows: whereas the
metalanguage is an internal language for co/monadic structure; the programming
language is the internal language for the derived structure of co/free
algebras for the co/monad---typically defined by the categorical co/Kleisli
construction~\cite{MacLane}.  In particular, the Kleisli category of a
computational monad provides a model of call-by-value~\cite{MoggiLambdaC};
while the coKleisli category of a linear exponential comonad provides one
of call-by-name~(\ie,~a cartesian closed category)~\cite{Seely}.

The programming languages corresponding to the metalanguages of the
polarised models~(\ref{LCBPV}) and~(\ref{LEEC}) should be the internal
languages for an analogous, but more intricate, construction relative to
an adjunction rather than a co/monad.  In this context, the following will
be investigated.
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{4}
\item
  What is the mathematical structure of such construction?  
  %
  The question is challenging.  For instance, we envisaged models of {\LC} to
  arise in this manner and, because of the interaction with call-by-value and
  call-by-name modes of computation, the structure should be more general than
  that of a category.

\item
  What would then be the mathematical theory of universal constructions for
  these structures giving rise to logical connectives?  
  %
  Note again from considering {\LC} that this will be subtle, requiring
  constructions of objects with mixed polarities.

\item
  What can the resulting direct-style calculi contribute to programming?
  For discussion on this see Section\pref{ProgrammingEffectsParagraph}.

\paragraph{Modal logics.}
\label{ModalLogicsParagraph}

Recall from Section\pref{ResourcesEffectsModalitiesParagraph} that resource
comonads and effect monads are modalities.  Polarisation in the context of
modal logics has not been considered yet.  We will thus complement the
previous section with the 
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{0}
\item

\end{resenumerate}

Our overall goal here is to
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{1}
\item
  Develop the Propositions-as-Types correspondence for modal logics.
\end{resenumerate}
Here, we are specially interested in grounding it through categorical models
(see Figure\,\ref{ResearchAreas}), that have been scarcely investigated.

Section\pref{MetaprogrammingParagraph}, we will be particularly interested
in studying:

\paragraph*{Categorical Type Theory.}

The evolution of term and type structure in type theories from its origin
to the current state can be succinctly represented as follows
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}\hline
  & \small Term Structure & \small Type Structure
  \\[.25mm] \hline\hline

\end{tabular}\end{center}
Surprisingly, this has not changed since de~Bruijn's Automath in the late
1960s.  We firmly believe that further evolution will come from mathematical
input and, in this direction, propose two lines of research for type theories
as formal languages of categorical structures.  
%These are presented in the two sections below.

\paragraph{Generalised Type Theory.}
\label{GeneralisedTypeTheoryParagraph}

We present work discussed with Gambino (DMI, Universit\`a degli Studi di
Palermo) and Hyland (DPMMS, University of Cambridge) with whom the development
will be undertaken.  

Section\pref{MethodologyMathematicalUniversesParagraph} considers presheaf
categories in the large as mathematical universes of discourse (or gros
toposes).  There is however an alternative view of them in the small as
spaces (or petit toposes) with morphisms between them given by linear (or
cocontinuous) functors, resulting in the bicategory of profunctors (or
distributors)~\cite{Benabou}.  Lawvere~\cite{LawvereMetric} considered
these structures in the general context of enriched category theory and
synthesised a Generalised Logical Calculus out of them.  The enrichments
give rise to different interpretations, \eg~in preorders, categories, and
metric spaces.

The general goal of our research here is to:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{0}
\item\label{GeneralisedTypeTheoryItem}
   Develop a type theory providing a Propositions-as-Types interpretation of
   the Generalised Logical Calculus.
\end{resenumerate}
This is to be investigated in two stages, respectively corresponding to
enrichment over cartesian closed categories and over symmetric monoidal
closed categories.  
\hide{
In the first case, one roughly has the following
translation table between the Generalised Logical Calculus and Predicate
Logic.
\begin{center}\small\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
    sum & disjunction\\ 
    coend & existential quantification\\ 
  product & conjunction\\ 
  end & universal quantification\\ 
  exponential & implication\\ 
  hom & equality\\ 
  presheaf application & predicate membership\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}
The second stage introduces linearity. 
}

Success 
in this endeavour %here 
will yield a system where the mathematical
calculations done with profunctors (\eg~in the context of the coherence of
profunctor composition~\cite{Benabou}, the mathematical theory of
substitution~\cite{FioreFossacs}, generalised species of
structures~\cite{Species}, and generalised polynomial
functors~\cite{FioreICALP}) can be established formally.

Intuitively, the coend and end constructions mentioned in the table above are
quotients of dependent sums under a compatibility condition and restrictions
of dependent products under a parametricity condition.  Taking this view
seriously, we will aim to:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{1}
\item
  Extend
  item~\textbf{\ref{GeneralisedTypeTheoryParagraph}}\thinspace\itemref{GeneralisedTypeTheoryItem}
  to a fully-fledged, possibly higher-dimensional, dependent type theory.  
\end{resenumerate}

\hide{
Finally, in an intriguing complementary direction,
Fiore~\cite{FioreFossacs} has suggested a graphical reading of the
Generalised Logical Calculus that is surprisingly close to formalisms for
categorical graphical languages~\cite{Selinger}, and
proof~\cite{GirardLinearLogic}/interaction~\cite{Lafont} nets.  This
aspect deserves investigation.
}

\paragraph{Directed Type Theory.}
\label{DirectedTypeTheoryParagraph}

Homotopy Type Theory (under the acronym HoTT, and the slogan `types are
spaces') is the name being used for the body of work at the boundary between
Homotopy Theory and Dependent Type Theory through Identity Types.

The question arises:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{0}
\item
  Is there a notion of Directed Type connecting Higher-Dimensional Category
  Theory and Dependent Type Theory on which to establish a body of work on
  Directed Type Theory (DiTT)?
\end{resenumerate}
In this context, while an Identity Type
  \[
  \Id_T(x,y)
\]
is intended to establish the intensional equality of elements of a type $T$ so
that $\Id_T(x,y)$ and $\Id_T(y,x)$ are equivalent; the intuitive idea behind a
Directed Type 
  \[
  \Di_T(x,y)
\]
would be to classify the possible ways in which an element of a type $T$ may
evolve to another one in a possibly irreversible manner; as it happens, for
instance, in computation.  Thereby leading to not necessarily equivalent types
$\Di_T(x,y)$ and $\Di_T(y,x)$, and to the DiTT slogan `types are directed
spaces'.

An analysis of the elimination rule for Identity Types reveals that there
are at least two sources leading to their inherent reversible character.
We mention them below as possible directions of research for investigating
Directed Types.
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{1}
\item
  The use of contexts that allow the commutativity of two consecutive
  variables of the same type, which suggests moving on to a non-commutative
  setting (as \eg~in non-commutative linear logic).
  %~\cite{NatDedForIntNonCommLinLog}).  
  %(This is related to the considerations in
  %Section\pref{SubstructuralTypeTheoryParagraph} below.)

\item\label{TypeDualityItem}
  The lack of a type duality, a property that seems to be inherent to
  directionality, whereby every type $T$ has an associated dual type $T^\circ$
  for which $\Di_T(x,y)$ and $\Di_{T^\circ}(y,x)$ are equivalent.  
\end{resenumerate}

The previous item is of course related to the considerations of the
previous section.  Pursuing this further, it would be natural to
generalise from presheaves, now regarded as discrete fibrations, to the
general notion of fibration~\cite{SGA1} and aim to:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{3}
\item
  Develop a type theory modelled on Grothendieck fibrations.
\end{resenumerate}

\hide{
As a final point, we note that yet another approach would be to:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{4}
\item
  Investigate a directed-cylinder construction, intuitively adding a new base
  point to a type that canonically evolves to every element.  
\end{resenumerate}
This would generalise the lifting construction of Domain
Theory~\cite{LiftingKZ} and possibly establish connections with the
Complete Cuboidal Sets model of Axiomatic Domain
Theory~\cite{CompleteCuboidalSets} opening new directions.  
}

\paragraph{Substructural Type Theory.}
\label{SubstructuralTypeTheoryParagraph}

The work of Bellantoni and Cook~\cite{BellantoniCook}
%, after Leivant~\cite{Leivant}, 
on implicit computational complexity gave a characterisation of the
polynomial-time computable functions on finite strings by means of a
safe-recursion scheme that restricted primitive recursion.  A crucial
ingredient of their approach is to divide function arguments into normal and
safe ones.  Recursion is allowed on normal arguments but not on safe ones.  In
the terminology that we have been using, normal arguments are linear while
safe ones are cartesian.  In fact, the notion of safe composition
coincides with that for mixed linear/cartesian operads (see
item~\textbf{\ref{WiringStructureParagraph}}\thinspace\itemref{BellantoniCook}).
%on page~\pageref{BellantoniCook}).  
Since then, the role of resource management in taming complexity has been
prominently recognised, and a big body of work on implicit computational
complexity (\eg~on soft, bounded, light, and linear logics and types) has
followed.
% Baillot, Dal Lago, Hofmann, Lafont

Recently, Beckmann, Buss, and Friedman~\cite{BeckmannBussFriedman} 
%and later on Arai~\cite{Arai} 
have extended the safe-recursion scheme to arbitrary set functions.
Changing viewpoint form the mathematical universe of sets to that of
types, one is lead to:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{0}
\item
  Extend dependent type theory to the mixed linear/cartesian setting.

In particular, in what concerns to taming computational complexity:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{1}
\item
  Investigate a safe version of the Induction-Recursion scheme of
  Dybjer~\cite{DybjerIR}.  
\end{resenumerate}
This development should be also accompanied by a model theory, possibly based
on 
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{2}
\item 
  Realisability models relative to the Linear Combinatory Algebras of
  Abramsky, Haghverdi, and Scott~\cite{AHS}.

\subsubsection{Programming}
\label{Programming}

This track of the proposal is concerned with the design and implementation
of programming languages from first principles and pragmatics, followed up
by their subsequent test, use, and distribution.

Three directions for this research are presented.  These will be
considered as units in their own right, and also in relation to each other.

\setcounter{paragraph}{0}
\paragraph{Indexed programming.}
\label{IndexedProgrammingParagraph}

This section outlines work under discussion with Ahn and Sheard
(Department of Computer Science, Portland State University) on indexed
programming (recall Section\pref{IndexedProgrammingIntro}).

The main problem to be addressed here is to:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{0}
\item
  Design a language for programming indexed data structures that will
  inform the design of the next generation of programming languages.
\end{resenumerate}
The task can be approached from two different viewpoints.  In a top-down
fashion, one may turn dependent type theories into programming languages;
conversely, in a bottom-up fashion, one may extend functional programming
languages with indexing structure.  These two approaches pull the
programming language design into two opposite directions.

where the main features inherent to each approach are also listed.}

Most of the work in this area has concentrated on exploring the top-down
approach (see~\eg~\cite{Cayenne} and \cite{Epigram}).  Here we will pursue
research on the bottom-up approach, which has not been explored
systematically.  A strong pragmatic reason for this is that our uppermost
interest is in a language targeted to programmers.  This does not mean that we
are not interested in the activity of proving as in constructive proof
assistants.  However, our main goal, under the Propositions-as-Types paradigm,
is: 
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{1}
\item
  To prove properties as a by-product of programming; rather than to extract
  programs from proving properties.
\end{resenumerate}
For this to be meaningful, both in theory and practice, the language will
need to guarantee logical consistency in a setting that naturally allows
programming strong invariants for rich indexing type structure.  For
instance, so that the code of a compiler guarantees its correctness.

In the above direction, we are investigating:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{2}
\item
  {\SystemFi}: an extension of {\SystemFomega} with static type-indexing
  structure.
\end{resenumerate}
{\SystemFi} is to serve as the mathematical foundation for designing, and
giving operational semantics to, our programming language.  We stress here
that indices are static, \ie~determined at compile time.  This is the main
feature pulling us away from traditional dependently-typed formalisms.

The logical consistency of {\SystemFi} amounts to establishing its strong
normalisation; while as an extension of {\SystemFomega} it will embody
rich type structure.  In this setting, following Ahn and
Sheard~\cite{AhnSheard11}, we will:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{3}
\item
  Study programming primitives corresponding to a variety of induction
  proof principles.
\end{resenumerate}
These are to be incorporated in the programming language design.  Here, it
is interesting to note that the scheme provided by Mendler's
iterator~\cite{MendlerIter}, that crucially takes advantage of
parametric polymorphism, allows for terminating iteration over recursively
defined datatypes of possibly mixed variance.  Thus, going beyond the
typical inductive types of type theory stemming from Dybjer's Inductive
Families~\cite{DybjerIF}.  It would be interesting to establish a formal
connection between these approaches so that they can inform each other;
in particular in the context of termination checking. %~\cite{AbelFoetus}. 

\hide{
Dually, we will also:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{4}
\item
  Develop programming primitives corresponding to coinduction proof
  principles.
\end{resenumerate}
These have received less attention.
}

The above design considerations are to be shaped by the following maxim:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{4}%{5}
\item
  Design language constructs with minimal type annotation supporting
  maximal type inference.
\end{resenumerate}
Indeed, this is the main open problem in dependently-typed programming language
theory.

\hide{
Finally, let us mention an intriguing possibility suggested by the
model-theoretic considerations of
Section\pref{MethodologyMathematicalUniversesParagraph}.  The indexing
structure in dependent type theory is discrete.  In many applications,
however, one is interested in indexed types that furthermore relate
structure on indices to structure on the associated indexed family of types.
The question arises as to how to:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{5}%{6}
\item
  Build idioms or language abstractions for defining and then programming
  with indexed types equipped with internal varying structure.
\end{resenumerate}
A specific motivation for this comes from the possibility of directly
programming, as opposed to having to code, presheaf structure (\eg~as is
needed in Normalisation by Evaluation~\cite{FiorePPDP}).
}

\paragraph{Effects.}
\label{ProgrammingEffectsParagraph}

Our main aim here is to consider the model-theoretic investigations of
Section\pref{PolarisationParagraph} from a proof-theoretic viewpoint and
percolate this down to programming language theory.

A first main novelty in our approach is that the proof theory to be
considered is based on sequent calculus, rather than the traditional line
followed so far in programming language foundations based on sequent-style
natural deduction.

The proof-theoretic formalism that we will be adhering to is the
calculus~{\SysL} mentioned in Section\pref{SequentCalculiParagraph}.  A first
main question that arises is:
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{0}
\item 
  What is the programming paradigm stemming from sequent calculi in
  general, and the calculus~{\SysL} in particular?
\end{resenumerate}
For instance, 
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{1}
\item
  Does the inherent symmetry of the {\SysL}~formalism lead to a new programming
  style?

\item
  How can the close connection between the system~{\SysL} and abstract
  machines be exploited?  For instance, in formal compiler correctness.
\end{resenumerate}
These investigations will also require mathematical principles to be
developed.  Specifically, we will 
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{3}
\item
  Establish a Propositions-as-Types 
  %correspondence for sequent calculi through Category Theory (see
  %Figure\,\ref{ResearchAreas}) relating the system~{\SysL} to adjoints.
  trinity (see (\ref{PATtrinity})) between classical sequent calculi and
  computational languages with effects and rich type structure through
  adjoint interpretations.
\end{resenumerate}

As for polarisation, we believe that programmers will be able to intuitively
assimilate the eager {\vs}~lazy modes of computation and data structures
underlying it.  But, pragmatically,
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{4}
\item
  How will a programmer be able to easily code polarisation in a
  programming language?
\end{resenumerate}

Once the above is sorted, one can consider experimenting with programming
languages based on the various systems of
Section\pref{PolarisationParagraph} further enriched with computational
effects.  To this end, there is a large body of theoretical work on
effects that needs to be examined, evaluated, and reconsidered.  An
interesting stepping stone here is the recent work of Bauer and
Pretnar~\cite{BauerPretnar} on the experimental programming language Eff.  

Eff is based on the algebraic theory of effects and handlers of Plotkin
\etal~\cite{PlotkinPowerAlgOpsAndGenEffs,PlotkinPretnar};
but, for the pragmatics of supporting seemingly non-algebraic control
operators, it goes beyond algebraic models.  This is indeed so with
respect to (first-order) algebraic theories.  Interestingly, as it has
transpired in conversation between Fiore and Staton, the consideration of
the richer Second-Order Algebraic Theories of Fiore
\etal~\cite{FioreHurLMCS,FioreMahmoud} seems to enrich the class of
specifiable effects to incorporate aspects of control.  Thus, our research
into this topic will also
\begin{resenumerate}\setcounter{CC}{5}
\item
  Investigate Second-Order (and, when they are developed, Polymorphic)
  Algebraic Theories as a mathematical basis for an algebraic theory of
  effects encompassing control.
\end{resenumerate}
Targeted goals here will be program logics for effects and control, and formal
correctness proofs of (continuation and/or abstract machine) implementations
of programming languages with effects.

  TDPE with sums: reflection with delimited control operators

  System $F_\omega^*$: Tillmann Rendel, Klaus Ostermann, Christian
  Hofer (2009),Typed Self-Representation

{\bf feel free to change any of this -- Tim}

In a metaprogramming system there are two languages of interest. The
object-language which is the object of study and the meta-language which
manipulates object programs as data. The purpose of the meta-language is
to define algorithms for the purpose of constructing or analyzing
object-programs. Metaprograms play a role in many kinds of systems

{\bf Generic programming.}
One style of generic programming defines a datastucture that reflects how
users define new types. For example, a value of type \verb+Def Tree+
describes how a new \verb+Tree+ datatype is defined. A generic program then
analyzes this structure of \verb+Def+ types to write code parametric over
any user defined type. For example a generic equality might have type
\verb+Def t -> t -> t -> Bool+ and a generic marshalling function
might have type \verb+Def t -> t -> List Bit+. 

{\bf Reflection.} One kind of reflection is where the object-language and
the meta-language coincide

%\subsection*{\S\enspace\thinspace Personal statement}

My research is in theoretical computer science, and by its own nature develops
in the context of close specialised collaboration.  My work stems from the
interaction between two approaches: abstract and concrete. At the abstract
level, I build mathematical theories. At the concrete level, theories are
applied to specific problems. This duality has yielded deep results and
provided research breadth, giving fundamental contributions to a variety of
fields and finding connections among them; \eg~domain theory, category theory,
concurrency theory, sheaf theory, type theory, logic, algebra.  Indeed,
note that I publish in computer science and mathematics venues, and I have
been invited speaker at both computer science and mathematics meetings.
My \mbox{h-index} is 21, according to Google scholar.
