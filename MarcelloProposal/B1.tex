\subsection{Proposal}

\paragraph*{General aim.}

Headed by Principal Investigator Marcelo Fiore, {\erc} assembles an
international team of world-leading experts in theoretical and applied
computer science.  The project builds a group of researchers
dedicated to combined research in Category Theory, Mathematical Logic,
Programming Theory, and Type Theory.  Specifically, to understand and develop
formal languages and mathematical models for computer programming and
mathematical proof. 

\paragraph*{Working thesis.}

The research is driven by the thesis that
\begin{myquote}
\item
Languages 
for computer programming
and languages 
for mathematical proof 
are of the same character.
\end{myquote}
This view %conception 
%%is of course not original to us.  It 
was first developed in the 1960s %, with proponents from computer science
%(\eg~McCarthy, Dijkstra, Hoare, Strachey) and from mathematics (\eg~de Bruijn,
%Scott, Martin-L\"of); 
and is now central to research in programming languages and constructive
mathematics.

An aspect of the thesis that is fundamental to us here is usually referred
to as the Proofs-as-Programs or Propositions-as-Types correspondence.
%There is an aspect of the thesis that is rooted in the constructive
%approach to mathematical practice and is fundamental to us here.  This 
It can be impressionistically %roughly 
presented %as a correspondence 
as follows
\[%\begin{equation}\label{PATproportion}%\xymatrix@C5pt{
%  \frac{\txt{program}}{\txt{Type}} 
%  & \mbox{\Large$\approx$} & 
%  \frac{\txt{proof}}{\txt{Proposition}}
%}
%
  \mbox{proof : Proposition} 
  \enspace \approx \enspace 
  \mbox{program : Type} 
%\end{equation}
\]
and one intuitively explains the correspondence along these lines: %the lines below:
%\begin{myitemize} 
%\item 
  to give a constructive proof of a proposition 
  %(\eg~that every number is smaller than a prime number) 
  is to construct a program that certifies the statement, 
  %(\eg~one that on inputing a number, outputs some prime number bigger
  %than it);
  while
%\item 
  to type a program is to establish a property of that program.
  %(\eg~that certain input/output behaviour or invariant is maintained). 
%\end{myitemize} 

Research stemming from the Propositions-as-Types correspondence has been
very fruitful.  Many of its mathematical theories have been implemented as
computer systems, and used academically and industrially.  Cases in point
are: programming languages for high-assurance code and proof assistants
for computer-aided verification; examples of which are
Haskell, %~\cite{Haskell} 
an industrial-strength functional programming language, 
and Coq, %~\cite{Coq} 
a proof assistant in which bodies of mathematics are being verified.

\paragraph*{The future.}

Transfering mathematical theories to computer
systems has required both technical/theoretical and technological/applied
progress.  This has necessarily demanded increasingly specialised, and to
some extent fragmentary, research.  
Importantly, %though, 
the field has reached a first plateau; encompassing a substantial body of
work and expertise.  
How %But, how
will it continue to advance?  
By considering new directions and challenges, of course.  
But, 
it is our firm view that
% as in the very beginning of the subject, 
it will be essential to do so by generating questions and tackling problems
from the perspectives of a variety of research areas.  
It is both of these aspects that we put forward here.

\paragraph*{Our philosophy.}

Two disciplines are clearly involved in investigating the
Proofs-as-Programs 
correspondence: %~(\ref{PATproportion}) above:
Mathematical Logic and Programming Theory.  
%Much research, as the one proposed here, is geared towards finding a middle
%ground that can accommodate the concerns of both, and expand their 
%realms. %domains.
%
However, this is only half of the picture.  The full 
picture also involves the disciplines of Type Theory and Category
Theory.  
%Their role is to enrich~(\ref{PATproportion}) as follows 
%\[\xymatrix@C5pt@R2.5pt{

gives a schematic view of the interactions between these four research areas
in this context.  Each of them is complementary to the others.  Together, as a
unified whole, they have shaped fields of computer science and mathematics.  
\hide{
Indeed, consider for instance that: 
\begin{myitemize}
\item
  the categorical interpretation of quantifiers as
  adjoints~\cite{LawvereAinF} informed the development of the
  type-theoretic dependent sums and dependent products~\cite{ScottCV};
\item
  type theories are the foundation of programming-language typing
  systems~\cite{Pierce};
\item
  the control operators of programming languages are key to the
  constructive interpretation of classical proofs~\cite{Griffin}; and 
\item
  model-theoretic studies of the polymorphic lambda
  calculus~\cite{GirardSystemF,Reynolds} led to remarkable small complete
  categories~\cite{Hyland}.
\end{myitemize}
}
%
It is within this framework that we propose cross-cutting research in Category
Theory, Mathematical Logic, Programming Theory, and Type Theory.  
We %Furthermore, we 
contend that an approach neglecting any one of them is to the detriment of
the others; missing the depth and richness of the subject and, crucially,
missing opportunities for research and development.  

\paragraph{Main goals.}

The motivations for our research proposal are specifically as follows. 
\begin{myitemize}
\item[\raisebox{.75mm}{\tiny$\bigstar$}]\hspace*{-2mm}
  To search for %elucidate 
  %what we hope to be 
  the next-generation framework of Type Theory
  relevant to computer science and mathematics.
\item[\raisebox{.75mm}{\tiny$\bigstar$}]\hspace*{-2mm}
  To exercise and test Category Theory both as a unifying and as a
  foundational mathematical language.
\item[\raisebox{.75mm}{\tiny$\bigstar$}]\hspace*{-2mm}
  To broaden the current role of Mathematical Logic in computation.
\item[\raisebox{.75mm}{\tiny$\bigstar$}]\hspace*{-2mm}
  %To develop Programming Theory, designing, implementing, and experimenting
  %with languages of the future.
  To design, implement, and experiment within Programming Theory, looking
  into the languages of the future.
\end{myitemize}

We particularly aim to contribute with: a framework to analyse and synthesise
type theories; mathematical theories and models for computational phenomena;
formal calculi for proof and/or computation; and experimental high-level
programming languages.

\paragraph{Research programme.}

The research programme has been precisely conceived to target the goals
above.  It is organised in four strands as outlined below.
\begin{myitemize}
\item[{\bfseries 1\enspace Foundations:}]\mbox{}\enspace\thinspace 
  \emph{A comprehensive research programme on the metamathematics of type
    theories.}
  %--- addressing the problem of what type theories are.

  \vspace*{1mm}
  We will address the fundamental question of what type theories are,
  which will also lead us to rethink them.  
  Our approach 
  %is novel and ambitious.  It 
  aims at an algebraic framework that will generalise to type theories all
  aspects of our current understanding of algebraic
  theories. %, from the perspectives of categorical algebra,
  %equational logic, and universal algebra. 
  %%(see the Algebraic Trinity of Figure~\ref{} on page~\pageref{}).  
  The scale at which we will be attempting this is unprecedented,
  systematically exploring a wide spectrum of key type-theoretic features.
  \vspace*{1mm}

\item[{\bfseries 2\enspace Models:}]\mbox{}\enspace\thinspace
  \emph{Study of mathematical models for type theories and logical systems.}
  %--- targeting semantic problems at the forefront of current understanding. 

  \vspace*{1mm}
  We will tackle semantic problems at the forefront of current understanding.
  %
  In the context of type theories, we will conduct investigations
  concerning a main problem in the area: to reconcile extensional equality
  and intensional identity (which, roughly, respectively correspond to the
  mathematical and computational notions of sameness).  
  %
  In the context of logical systems, we will develop both %novel 
  calculi suggested by mathematical models and %new 
  models for so far intractable calculi, encompassing aspects of resource
  management and computational effects.  
  %A distinguishing novelty of our approach is that it will be informed by the
  %logical notion of polarisation.
  \vspace*{-3mm}%%%HACK!!!
  
\item[{\bfseries 3\enspace Calculi:}]\mbox{}\enspace\thinspace
  \emph{Development of formalisms of deduction as internal languages of
    mathematical models.}
  %--- researching type theories that go beyond current logical frameworks. 
  
  \vspace*{1mm}
  We will aim at evolving the term and type structure of current type
  theories, which in essence has not changed since the late 1960s.  Pursuing
  the view that further evolution will come from mathematical input, we will
  research type theories as formal languages of (higher-dimensional)
  categorical structures.  
  \vspace*{1mm}

\item[{\bfseries 4\enspace Programming:}]\mbox{}\enspace\thinspace
  \emph{Design and implementation of novel computational languages.}
  %--- %looking into the 
  %engineering %of first 
  %principles and concepts from mathematical theories.

  \vspace*{1mm}
  Guided by mathematical theories and pragmatics, we will look into the
  engineering of principles and concepts for programming, exporting them to
  language designs and implementations.  We will specifically consider
  experimental languages, supporting indexed data structures, computational
  effects, and metaprogramming.  
\end{myitemize}

\paragraph{The team.}

The team to pursue the research programme will be led by 
%\begin{myitemize}
%  \item 
    Principal Investigator~(PI) \emph{Marcelo Fiore} 
    (Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge): 
    a %world-
    leading expert in applications of category theory to computer science,
    including abstract algebra, concurrency theory, programming-language
    semantics, sheaf theory, and type theory.  
%\end{myitemize}
%
He will be 
backed up %supported 
by an international group of three Senior Visiting Researchers~(SVRs):
%(that are to visit the PI for one month per year): 
%\begin{myitemize}
%\item 
  \emph{Pierre-Louis Curien} 
  (Laboratoire PPS, Univerist\'e Paris Diderot - Paris~7): 
  a %world-
  leading expert in programming-language semantics, with contributions
  into category theory, logic, %rewriting theory, 
  and type theory; 
%\item
  \emph{Peter Dybjer} 
  (Department of Computer Science, Chalmers University of Technology): 
  a %world-
  leading expert in type theory, including its connections with category
  theory and logic, and its implementation in proof assistants; and 
%\item
  \emph{Tim Sheard} 
  (Department of Computer Science, Portland State University): 
  a %world-
  leading expert in pro\-gram\-ming-language design and implementation,
  encompassing functional and metaprogramming systems. 
%\end{myitemize}
%
The PI is to collaborate with the SVRs by mutual research visits, email, and
conference calls.
%
The team is completed by three outstanding Research Associates~(RAs) to be
based at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, under the PI.  They
are
%\begin{myitemize}
%\item
  \emph{Ki Yung Ahn}
  (Department of Computer Science, Portland State University): 
  a PhD student of %Tim 
  Sheard currently writing up his dissertation on the design and
  implementation of a language for indexed programming;
%\item
  \emph{Nicola Gambino}
  (Dipartimento di Matematica e Informatica, Universit\`a degli Studi di
  Palermo):  
  an established researcher in the areas of type theory and category theory,
  with whom the PI has already collaborated; and 
%\item
  \emph{Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni}
  (Laboratoire PPS, Univerist\'e Paris Diderot - Paris~7): 
  a PhD student of %Pierre-Louis 
  Curien writing up his dissertation on the Propositions-as-Types
  correspondence in the context of classical logic.
%\end{myitemize}
Currently, the two junior RAs lack future funding.  All RAs would be ready
to join the project from the start.

\subsection{Origins and influences}
\label{Origins}

This section sketches the origins and influences that led to the holistic
conception of Figure\,\ref{ResearchAreas}. 
%, roughly expanding through 1935 to 1985.
It is important to appreciate and understand our scientific framework.

\hide{
Section\pref{StateOfTheArtSubsection} describes the current state of the
field and raises questions for research.  %Having set the scene,
Section\pref{ObjectivesSubsection} presents the research objectives we
wish to pursue and the team that we have assembled to reach them.  
%Both of these points are further expounded upon in
%Sections\,(\ref{MethodologySection}\,\&\,\ref{ResourcesSection}).
}

\paragraph{Logic and computation.}

%It is worth recalling that 
Computer science was born as a branch of mathematics, specifically
mathematical logic. %, even before the first electronic computers were built.
Its inception %The inception of computer science 
was Hilbert's %~\cite{?}
1928 Decision Problem, %Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem),
asking whether there is an algorithmic procedure for deciding mathematical
statements.  Negative answers were provided independently by
Church %~\cite{Church1936} 
in 1936 and 
Turing %~\cite{Turing} 
in 1937,
giving birth to the mathematical theory of computation.  Their completely
different approaches gave rise to different branches of theoretical
computer science that still persist today.  
The %On one hand, the 
line
of development starting with Church's {\lcalculus} %~\cite{?} 
concerns itself with prototypical computational languages that are
used to study high-level programming languages.  
%On the other hand, Turing's machines %~\cite{?} 
%are the most widely 
%used model for analysing computational complexity.
%
This %Church's 
view is central to this proposal.  
\hide{
The {\lcalculus} is a
deceptively simple formal system.  Its syntax consists of three types of
phrases: variables, applications, and abstraction.  Church's seminal
innovation was in introducing the latter one, 
%the other two being already familiar form the realm of
%algebra~\cite{Birkhoff}, 
which in modern terminology is referred to as a binding operator, a notion
that goes beyond the operators of universal algebra. %~\cite{Birkhoff}.
Binding operators are an integral part of all high-level programming
languages.  
%Their mathematical theory is subtle %, see~\ref{}, 
%because they define syntax up to the consistent renaming of bound
%variables (technically referred to as \mbox{$\alpha$-equivalence}).
%This subtlety is made evident by the anecdotal fact that the first definitions
%of substitution were formally flawed.  
%%These important topics are core to our proposed research in
%%Section\pref{AlgebraicTypeTheoryParagraph}.
}

%Incidentally, the notion of variable binding was initially introduced much
%earlier, by Frege~\cite{Frege1879}, in the context of mathematical logic.  
%He used binders to define a formal symbolic
%system axiomatising not only the propositional connectives of Boolean
%logic~\cite{Boole} but also, for the first time, the quantifiers of
%predicate logic.

%The %In modern notation, the 
%{\lcalculus} syntax is given by
%  \[\begin{array}{rcll}
%    s , t & ::= & & \mbox{($\lambda$-terms)}\\
%      & \mid & x & \quad\mbox{(variables)}\\
%      & \mid & (t)s & \quad\mbox{(application)}\\
%      & \mid & \lambda x.\,t & \quad\mbox{(abstraction)}
%  \end{array}\]
%The system has only one rule of computation:
%  \begin{equation}\label{BetaReduction}\begin{array}{rl}
%(\beta) & (\lambda x.\,t)s \,\longrightarrow\, t[s/x]
%  \end{array}\end{equation}
%by which the result of computing a so-called redex $(\lambda x.\,t)s$ is
%the \mbox{$\lambda$-term} $t[s/x]$ denoting the result of substituting the
%free occurrences of $x$ in $t$ by $s$.  Non-terminating behaviour arises from
%self application.

\paragraph{Type theory and logic.}
\label{SectionATypeTheoryAndLogicParagraph}

The concept of `type' was conceived to solve a foundational
problem.  In 1903, %~\cite{Frege1903}, building on~\cite{Frege1879}, 
Frege proposed
a logical system as a foundation for mathematics.
%including arithmetic.  
In his now famous paradox, 
Russell %~\cite{Russell1902}
observed that one of Frege's axioms led to inconsistency.  
%He was led to this contradiction by related contradictions he found while
%developing his account of set theory.  
To overcome such foundational problems, 
he %Russell 
introduced the `doctrine of types'. 
% --- typed systems can avoid these inconsistencies.

Type Theory, as we now know it, arose from the integration by Church
of types into his \lcalculus, yielding the %so-called 
Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus. %~\cite{Church1940}.  
This was a natural step, particularly if one held the naive interpretation of
\mbox{$\lambda$-abstraction} as defining functions.  
%The type theory known as the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus has a set of types
%consisting of basic ones
%closed under a function-type constructor. %:
%\[\begin{array}{rcll}
%    \sigma,\tau & ::= & & \mbox{(simple types)}\\
%    & \mid & \theta & \quad\mbox{(basic types)}\\
%    & \mid & \sigma\to\tau & \quad\mbox{(function types)}
%  \end{array}\]
%In the Simply-Typed Lambda
%Calculus, \mbox{$\lambda$-terms}~$t$ are classified by types~$\tau$, in
%contexts $\Gamma$ (assigning types to variables), for which the notation
%$\Gamma\vdash t:\tau$
%is commonly used.  This is done according to syntax-directed rules. 
% that in the mathematical vernacular are presented as follows
%  \[
%  \begin{array}{c}
%    \\ \hline
%    x_1:\tau_1,\ldots,x_n:\tau_n\vdash x_i:\tau_i
%  \end{array}
%  \enspace(1\leq i\leq n)
%\]
%  \[\begin{array}{c}
%    \Gamma\vdash t:\sigma\to\tau

A fundamental discovery relating Mathematical Logic to Type Theory was
made by Curry and by Howard.
%in two slightly different, though related, logical
%contexts (technically, Hilbert-style deduction %~\cite{Hilbert} 
%and Gentzen's natural deduction in sequent form). %~\cite{Gentzen1935}).
This is the Propositions-as-Types correspondence; roughly establishing a
correspondence between terms having types and proofs proving propositions.
%(\cf~(\ref{PATproportion})).  
%For the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus, the correspondence
%can be illustrated by noting that the erasure of term information in 
%the typing rules (given above) 
%yields the deduction rules
%\[\begin{array}{c}
%  \begin{array}{c}
%    \\ \hline
%    \tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n\vdash \tau_i
%  \end{array}
%  \enspace(1\leq i\leq n)
%  \\[4mm]
%  \begin{array}{c}
%    \Gamma\vdash \sigma\to\tau

%    \Gamma\vdash\tau
%  \end{array}
%  \enspace\quad
%  \begin{array}{c}
%    \Gamma,\sigma\vdash\tau
%    \\ \hline
%    \Gamma\vdash\sigma\to\tau
%  \end{array}
%\end{array}
%\]
%derivable judgements $x_1:\tau_1,\ldots,x_n:\tau_n\vdash t:\tau$ yields the
%valid judgements $\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n\vdash\tau$ 
%of Intuitionistic %Minimal 
%Logic. %~\cite{?}.

In another very important direction Church introduced a Simple Theory of
Types %~\cite{Church1940} 
as an axiomatization of Higher-Order Logic.
This axiomatization was formalised within a Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus.
%with basic types for both individuals and propositions, further enriched with
%constants for the logical connectives.  
In doing so, he adopted a radically new perspective, shifting the status
of the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus from that of a `language' to a
`metalanguage'. %;~\ie, a language in which it is possible to represent and
%work with other languages. 
%In this particular case for simple type theories.  
\hide{
  When regarded as a metalanguage, the Simply-Typed
Lambda Calculus is considered as an equational theory. %, with the
%computational \mbox{$\beta$-rule}~(\ref{BetaReduction}) stated as an
%equation together with the extensionality equation

%(\eta) & \lambda x.\,(t)x = t 
%& \mbox{, where $x$ is not free in $t$}
%  \end{array}\]

The processes of abstracting from languages to metalanguages has become a
common activity in computer science, and plays an important role in our
proposed investigations.

\paragraph{Category theory, logic, and type theory.}

\hide{
The theory of categories was introduced by Eilenberg and Mac
Lane~\cite{EilenbergMacLane}.  A category is a mathematical structure
consisting of objects and morphisms.  Morphisms are classified
by pairs of objects. The notation $f:A\to B$ stipulates that $A$ and $B$ are
objects, and that $f$ is a morphism with domain $A$ and codomain~$B$.  
Categories come equipped with an associative law that composes pairs of
morphisms 
%as on the left below
%\begin{equation}\label{Category}
%  \begin{array}{c}
%  f:A\to B\quad g:B\to C
%  \\ \hline
%  g\,f:A\to C
%\end{array}
%\quad\qquad
%1_A:A\to A
%\end{equation}
together with, for every object, an identity morphism 
%as on the right above
that is a neutral element for composition.  
%Categories were defined to introduce functors, a notion of morphism between
%categories, which in turn was defined to introduce natural transformations, a
%notion of morphism between functors.

In understanding categories, it is helpful to have in mind
that they have two kinds of uses: in the
large and in the small.  In the large, categories are seen as mathematical
universes of discourse (within which mathematical constructions take place,
typically by means of universal properties); like the categories of: sets and
functions, algebraic structures and homomorphisms, spaces and continuous
functions.  In the small, categories are seen as mathematical objects
themselves; like a set, a monoid, a preorder, and a graph, all of which can
be suitably regarded as a category.
}

Category Theory analyses mathematical structure by isolating the principles
for which mathematical theories work.  
%Because of this attention to essentials, it has had considerable success
%in unifying ideas from many areas of mathematics. 
%Today it an indispensable tool in abstract algebra, algebraic geometry,
%mathematical logic, mathematical physics, topology, and theoretical computer
%science, as well as a growing research area in its own right.
%
The connection between Category Theory, Logic, and Type Theory was
initiated by Lawvere %~\cite{LawvereAinF} 
and Lambek. %~\cite{LambekI}, 
%both
%of whom recognised logical systems and type theories as categories with
%structure.  
%Here we are concerned with the former, postponing the latter to the following
%section.

Lawvere's insight was to understand logical connectives and type
constructors as categorical structures arising from 
%universal properties in the form of 
adjoint functors. %, a notion introduced by Kan~\cite{Kan}
%motivated by homology theory.  
%For instance, the categories with structure corresponding to the Simply-Typed
%Lambda Calculus with products are Cartesian Closed Categories.  These have
%categorical products and exponentials 
%, respectively denoted $\times$ and $\Rightarrow$, 
%defined by adjoint situations.
%establishing natural bijective correspondences between
%morphisms as follows:
%  \[
%  \begin{array}{c}
%    C\to A \enspace,\enspace C\to B
%    \\ \hline\hline
%    C\to (A\times B)
%  \end{array}
%  \quad\qquad
%  \begin{array}{c}
%    (C\times A)\to B
%    \\ \hline\hline
%    C\to (A\Rightarrow B)
%  \end{array}
%\]
%The required naturality condition amounts to the computational $\beta$
%laws and the extensionality $\eta$ laws.
%
It
%The similarity between the bijective correspondence on the right above and the
%typing rule for \mbox{$\lambda$-abstraction}~(\ref{LambdaAbstraction}) is not
%casual, and it 
is now well-understood that the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus with products
provides an internal language for Cartesian Closed Categories; namely, it is
the calculus of all such models.  This view further enriches the
Propositions-as-Types correspondence as 
in the trinity below %in Figure\,\ref{PAT}.

\paragraph{Type theory and programming.}

The Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus 
%, regarded as a language rather than as a metalanguage, 
is a prototypical functional programming language.  The change of
perspective from Type Theory to Programming Theory is not straightforward
and comes with considerations that enrich both subjects.  

In the context of programming languages, Milner %~\cite{Milner1978}
understood early on that while a programming language should come with a
type discipline to classify programs according to their type invariants,
programmers would be better served if type annotations were inferred
automatically.  
%
The problem of type inference 
%(by which given a program one wishes to compute the best possible type for
%it) 
became of central practical importance.  
%For
%Combinatory Logic %\footnote{Combinatory Logic is an important symbolic
%  formalism introduced by Sch\"onfinkel~\cite{Schonfinkel} closely related
%  to the {\lcalculus}, but based on algebraic combinators, that enjoys the
%  Propositions-as-Types correspondence with respect to the Hilbert-style
%  deduction system for Intuitionistic %Minimal 
%  Logic.} 
%this problem was solved by Hindley. %~\cite{Hindley1969}.  
%Independently, 
Milner %~\cite{Milner1978} 
solved it %in a context more relevant to programming; namely, 
for the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus with parametric polymorphism.  
%The algorithm is known as the Hindley-Milner type inference method.  
%The approach is very robust. 
%, extending broadly to many related systems.
 
Polymorphism in programming refers to languages that support abstraction
mechanisms by which a program %(function or procedure) 
can be used with a variety of types.  The concept was introduced by 
Strachey. %~\cite{Strachey1967},
%who further classified the phenomena into ad-hoc polymorphism and parametric
%polymorphism.  The former is also referred to as overloading and accounts for
%uses of a program with different types (like integers and reals) by means of
%different algorithms.  The latter indicates the use of a uniform program for
%all types (like a duplicator program making copies of its input).
%
Reynolds %~\cite{Reynolds} 
formalised the programming intuition by introducing
the Polymorphic Typed Lambda Calculus. 
%; an extension of the Simply-Typed Lambda
%Calculus with polymorphic types.  
%Roughly, these are abstract parametric types
%whose programs can be used for all instances of the parameter.  
Strikingly,
this system had already been proposed %several years earlier 
by
Girard %~\cite{GirardSystemF} 
under the name of {\SystemF}, as the
type-theoretic counterpart of Second-Order Propositional Logic. 
%in the context of the Propositions-as-Types correspondence.  
Further, Girard had
also introduced {\SystemFomega}; the type-theoretic counterpart of
Higher-Order Propositional Logic.  
%These logical systems widely extend the
%expressiveness of the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus, notably by the
%possibility of encoding inductive data types. %~\cite{BoehmBerarducci}.
{\SystemFomega} lies at the core of the Haskell programming
language. %~\cite{EqProofICFP12}.

The above type systems aim at providing logical foundations.  When viewed
as programming languages, they can only introduce terminating
computations.  There are various ways in which one can extend them to
Turing
complete computational languages.  In this direction, 
%and motivated by model-theoretic studies of the \lcalculus, 
Scott %~\cite{ScottTCS}
introduced an extension of Typed Combinatory Logic with a fixpoint
combinator for general recursion.  Plotkin %~\cite{PlotkinLCF} 
studied it as a programming language
in the context of the %, shifting from Typed Combinatory Logic to
Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus, and %In doing so, he 
opened up further possible distinctions in the study of type theories for
computation; namely, the consideration of equational theories for
different function call mechanisms: by value or by name,
%~\cite{PlotkinCBVCBN}, 
as in ML or Haskell.  

%The influence of mathematical models on type theories, logical systems, and
%programming languages %as advocated by Scott~\cite{?} 
%plays a central role throughout the proposal.

\paragraph{Logical wiring.}
\label{LogicalWiringSubsection}

Lambek~\cite{LambekI} recognised the similarity between the basic
structure of a category, given by identities and
composition~(see\pref{Category}), and the wiring of logical deduction
systems, specifically Gentzen's sequent calculi~\cite{Gentzen1935}, given
by the axiom and cut rules.  Intuitionistic sequents led
Lambek~\cite{LambekII} to axiomatize their algebra under the concept of
multicategory.  This correspondence is roughly as outlined below (where the
vector notation $\vec{\,\cdot\,}$ stands for finite sequences of objects): 
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
    \begin{tabular}{c}

The analogous for classical sequents was done by Szabo~\cite{Szabo} with the
introduction of polycategories.

The structure of multicategory appeared independently in a very different
mathematical context, the work of May~\cite{May} on homotopical algebra, under
the name of Operad.  Operads are now central to studies in higher-dimensional
algebra (see~\eg~\cite{Leinster,LodayVallette}).

\paragraph{Dependent types.}
\label{DependentTypesParagraph}

Dependent type theory is a formalism introduced by
de~Bruijn %~\cite{deBruijn} 
that extends simple type theories by allowing types to be indexed 
%(or parameterised by) 
other types.  Such objects abound in computer science and mathematics.  
%For instance, in
%combinatorics one is interested in the type of permutations $\mathfrak
%S(n)$ on $n$ elements, as the index (or parameter) $n$ ranges over the
%natural numbers $\mathbb N$.  In modern notation, this is presented by a
%judgement of the form
%  \[
%  n:\mathbb N \vdash \mathfrak S(n) \mbox{ \mysf type}
%\]
There are two fundamental constructions on %such 
dependent judgements: %as follows
%\[
%  \begin{array}{c}
%  i: I \vdash T(i) \mbox{ \mysf type}
%  \\ \hline
%  \vdash \Sigma\,{i:\!I}.\, T(i) \mbox{ \mysf type}
%  \end{array}
%  \qquad
%  \begin{array}{c}
%  i: I \vdash T(i) \mbox{ \mysf type}
%  \\ \hline
%  \vdash \Pi\,{i:\!I}.\, T(i) \mbox{ \mysf type}
%  \end{array}
%\]
%respectively known as 
dependent sums and dependent product types.  %(see~\eg~\cite{Jacobs}).  
They generalise the product and function types of Simply-Typed Lambda
Calculus and, under the Propositions-as-Types correspondence, amount to
existential and universal quantification.  
%We omit discussing the syntax of terms for these types.  As for their
%equational theory, we only mention that dependent sums may be weak or strong
%and that dependent products may be intensional or extensional.
%%---see \eg~\cite{?}.

A fundamental problem in the area is to:
\rep{(\ref{IntensionalTypeTheoryParagraph})}
  {Investigate equality and identity in dependent type theory.}
%This lays at the core of our proposed investigations in
%Section\pref{IntensionalTypeTheoryParagraph}.

The passage from sum and product types to their dependent versions
required new type theories.  Categorical models suggest further
generalisations 
and the following %These are the subject of
%Sections\,(\ref{GeneralisedTypeTheoryParagraph}\,\&\,\ref{DirectedTypeTheoryParagraph})
%Section\pref{CalculiSubsection}
%under the following. 
\rep{(\ref{CalculiSubsection})}
  {Develop type theories from mathematical models.}

\paragraph{Mathematical universes.}
\label{MathematicalUniversesParagraph}

The ability to construct new mathematical universes of discourse from old ones
is a fundamental part of the technical toolkit of researchers in semantics, be
it either in logic or computation.

One technique to do so is to enrich the semantic universe with a `mode of
variation' by means of a so-called presheaf construction.  
%In its basic form, starting from the universe of sets and functions~$\Set$ one
%considers the universe~$\Set^{\scat C}$ of so-called presheaves consisting of
%the \mbox{$\scat C$-variable} sets for a small category~$\scat C$.  
%The importance of this passage is that the kind of variation embodied in the
%parameter small category translates to new, often surprising, internal
%structure in the universe of presheaves.  

%The presheaf construction was introduced by Grothendieck together with a
%more sophisticated and important refinement of it known as the sheaf
%construction~\cite{SGA4} (in the context of the Weil conjectures in
%cohomology theory).  Sheaves are a central object of study in the area of
%mathematics known as Topos Theory~\cite{Elephant}; a topos being a
%universe of discourse for Higher-Order Intuitionistic
%Logic~\cite{LambekScott}.  

The use of presheaf models in computer science applications has been
prominent;~\eg~in 
concurrency theory, %~\cite{?}, 
domain theory, %~\cite{?}, 
lambda calculus, %~\cite{?}, 
programming-language theory, %~\cite{?}, 
and type theory. %~\cite{?}.  
%
%In this view, 
%In view of the many possible applications, 
It is thus %it is 
natural to ask:
\reqs{(\ref{MethodologyMathematicalUniversesParagraph})}
  {Which mechanisms are there for changing from a type theory to another one
    as universes of discourse? 
%
    Can this be done while maintaining the relevant computational properties
    and then incorporated into mechanical proof assistants?}

%This question should not only be considered from the topos-theoretic viewpoint
%mentioned above; but also from other approaches, notably that of the related
%forcing technique of Cohen~\cite{Cohen} (introduced by him to prove the
%independence of both the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis from
%Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory) and its elaboration by Scott and Solovay as
%Boolean-valued models~\cite{ScottSolovay}.

%Recent work in this direction has been done by
%Coquand~\cite{CoquandForcingInTT} and Jaber, Tabareau, and
%Sozeau~\cite{TypeTheoryWithForcing}.\footnote{Note
%  that~\cite{TypeTheoryWithForcing}, despite its title, is about internalising
%  the presheaf construction on partial orders.}

\paragraph{Indexed programming.}
\label{IndexedProgrammingIntro}

In their most elementary discrete form, presheaves can be found in programming
languages as indexed datatypes; programming with which will be %generically
referred to as indexed programming.  

Indexed programming developed from two main influences:
%(none to do with presheaves though): 
the practical needs of supporting data structures able to
maintain strong data invariants, 
%, like nested %~\cite{?} 
%and generalised algebraic %~\cite{?}
%datatypes (GADTs) in functional programming~\cite{Omega,Haskell}; 
and the experimentation with dependently-typed programming
languages %~\cite{Cayenne,Epigram} 
as a by-product of dependent type theory.  These two views somehow pull in
opposite directions and, as such, lead to conceptually different
languages.  One is lead to investigate the following.
\rep{(\ref{IndexedProgrammingParagraph})} 
  {Develop foundational type theories for indexed datatypes.  
   % 
   Design and %subsequently 
   implement indexed programming languages from these and

\paragraph{Resources, effects, modalities.}
\label{ResourcesEffectsModalitiesParagraph}

In the late 1980s, two important analyses of computation, respectively for
resources and effects, were proposed by Girard %~\cite{GirardLinearLogic} 
and by Moggi. %~\cite{MoggiLambdaC}.  
The former was in the contexts of logic and proof theory; the latter in that
of denotational semantics and category theory.  Both %, however, have 
had tremendous impact in programming-language theory.  
%The resource analysis in the form of Linear Logic calculi; the effect
%analysis in the form of Computational \mbox{$\lambda$-calculi}.

\hide{
From the viewpoint of categorical models, the resource and effect management
structures are respectively seen as comonadic and monadic structures.
Comonads and monads being dual categorical concepts that arose in the context
of cohomology theory in the 1960s~\cite{BeckThesis}.

A classical basic result of category theory establishes a strong
correspondence between (co)monads and adjoint functors
(see~\eg~\cite{MacLane}).  One aspect of this is that every adjunction
  \begin{equation}\label{ResourceEffectAdjunction}
  \xymatrix@C=40pt{
    \cat D \ar@/^.75em/[r]|(.625){\mbox{$\,G\,$}}\ar@{}[r]|-\swvdash&
    \ar@/^.75em/[l]|(.625){\mbox{$\,F\,$}} \cat C }
\end{equation}
with $F$ and $G$ respectively left and right adjoint to each other, gives
rise (by composition) to a comonad on $\cat D$ and a monad on $\cat C$.  This
viewpoint gave impetus to further analyses based on the more primitive notion
of adjunction.  

Models of Linear Logic are founded on the theory of
monoidal categories~\cite[Chapter~VII.1]{MacLane}.  For them, one requests
that the adjunction be monoidal with respect to linear structure on $\cat D$
and cartesian (or multiplicative) structure on $\cat C$
(see~\eg~\cite{MelliesCMLL}).  On the other hand, models of Computational
\mbox{$\lambda$-calculi} rely on enriched category theory~\cite{KellyBook}.
Here, the structure is roughly given by an enriched adjunction with $\cat C$
cartesian and $\cat D$ with powers (or exponentials) relative to $\cat C$.
}

\hide{
In the context of Linear Logic, examples are the mixed linear/cartesian models
and calculi of Benton and Wadler, %~\cite{BentonWadler} 
and of Barber and Plotkin. %~\cite{BarberPlotkin}.  
In the context of effect calculi, examples are the Call-By-Push-Value of
Levy. %~\cite{LevyCBPV} 
and the Enriched Effect Calculus of 
Egger, M{\o}gelberg, and Simpson. %~\cite{EEC}.  
}
The predominant model-theoretic view of resources and effects is as
structures arising at opposite sides of an adjunction.  This is not so in
all models and the following question remains unanswered.
%
\req{\pref{PolarisationParagraph}}
  {How can resources and effects be reconciled and unified?}
%
To answer it, a broader view of the subject involving the orthogonal
notion of polarisation seems to be needed.  
This %From the programming-language viewpoint, this 
further enriches the computational picture with the ability of
distinguishing between eager \vs~lazy modes of computation and data
structures.  We incorporate this into the following.
%
\rep{(\ref{PolarisationParagraph}\,\&\,\ref{ProgrammingEffectsParagraph})}
  {Study and develop the theory of resource management, computational
    effects, and polarisation.  Percolate this down into the design of
    programming languages.}

\hide{
From the logical point of view, resource and effect structure are so-called
modal operators, and some of the literature has indeed considered them as
such.  %(see \eg~\cite{Kobayashi}).  %BiermanDePaiva
The field of modal logics is broad, with many subfields of specialised logics
motivated by computation, linguistics, and philosophy.  While a class of modal
logics known as temporal logics have played a prominent role, and been very
successful, in the area of computer aided verification; the impact of modal
logics on programming languages has been peripheral.  It is thus natural and
important to reconsider them in this context. 
%
\rep{(\ref{ModalLogicsParagraph}\,\&\,\ref{MetaprogrammingParagraph})}
  {Investigate the Propositions-as-Types 
    correspondence %Trinity

We stress that we are specially interested in modalities for computation with
reflection.

\paragraph{Sequent calculi.}
\label{SequentCalculiParagraph}

A theme that runs orthogonal to the logics under consideration is whether
they are specified in natural deduction or sequent calculus
style. %(see \eg~\cite{vonPlato}).

Most of the work on the Propositions-as-Types correspondence has been done for
natural deduction systems. %; especially in relation to programming
%language theory, where the logical syntax matches that of functional
%languages.  
%
On the other hand, there is as yet no established syntax for sequent-style
calculi.  
%A question at the core of this situation is:
Two questions at the core of this situation are:
%
\reqs{(\ref{ProgrammingEffectsParagraph})}
  {What is the categorical algebra of classical sequent calculi? %}
%
\hide{
Nevertheless, a syntactic formalism that is proving robust in applications
seems to be emerging.  This will be referred to as the calculus,
formalism, or system~\SysL; and underlies the ones developed
in~\eg~\cite{CurienHerbelin,Wadler,Munch,CurienMunch}.

The main novel features of the formalism~\SysL, and its philosophy, are an
intrinsic symmetry (corresponding to the computation roles of program and
environment) with syntax that reflects an adjoint situation and is closely
connected to abstract machines (which are in fact internal to the
calculus).  From this perspective we ask:

  What can the proof theory of sequent calculi do for programming?}

%\subsection*{\S\enspace\thinspace Personal statement}

My research is in theoretical computer science, and by its own nature develops
in the context of close specialised collaboration.  My work stems from the
interaction between two approaches: abstract and concrete. At the abstract
level, I build mathematical theories. At the concrete level, theories are
applied to specific problems. This duality has yielded deep results and
provided research breadth, giving fundamental contributions to a variety of
fields and finding connections among them; \eg~domain theory, category theory,
concurrency theory, sheaf theory, type theory, logic, algebra.  Indeed,
note that I publish in computer science and mathematics venues, and I have
been invited speaker at both computer science and mathematics meetings.
My \mbox{h-index} is 21, according to Google scholar.
