It is well known that datatypes can be embedded into polymorphic lambda
calculi by means of functional encodings,
such as the Church and Boehm-Berarducci encodings~\cite{BoehmBerarducci}.
\index{Church encoding}

\index{regular datatypes}
In System~\textsf{F}, one can embed \emph{regular datatypes},
like homogeneous lists:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\text{Haskell:} & \texttt{data List a = Cons a (List a) | Nil} \\
\text{System \textsf{F}:}~& 
\texttt{{List}}\:\: A\:\:\triangleq\:\:
\forall X.
(A\to X\to X) \to X \to X ~~\; \\
&
\quad~~
\texttt{Cons} \triangleq \l w.\l x.\l y.\l z.\,y\;w\,(x\;y\;z),~
\texttt{Nil} \triangleq \l y.\l z.z
\end{array}
\]
In such regular datatypes, constructors have algebraic structure that
directly translates into polymorphic operations on abstract types as
encapsulated by universal quantification over types (of kind $*$).

\index{type constructor}
In the more expressive System \Fw, where one can abstract over
type constructors of any kind, one can encode more general
\emph{type-indexed datatypes} that go beyond the regular datatypes.
For example, one can embed powerlists with heterogeneous elements
in which an element of type \texttt{a} is followed by
an element of the product type \texttt{(a,a)}:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\text{Haskell:} & \texttt{data Powl a = 
        PCons a (Powl(a,a))
        | 
        PNil 
} \\
& \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
  \textcolor{gray}{\small\texttt{-- PCons 1 (PCons (2,3) (PCons ((3,4),(1,2)) PNil)) :: Powl Int}}\\
\text{System \Fw:}~& \texttt{{Powl}}\:\triangleq\:
\lambda A^{*}.\forall X^{*\to*}. (A\to X(A\times A)\to X A) \to X A \to XA
\end{array}
\]
Note the non-regular occurrence (\texttt{Powl(a,a)}) in the definition of
(\texttt{Powl a}), and the use of universal quantification over
higher-order kinds ($\forall X^{*\to*}$).
The term encodings for {\small\tt PCons} and {\small\tt PNil} are exactly
the same as the term encodings for {\small\tt Cons} and {\small\tt Nil},
but have different types.

\index{datatype!term-indexed}
What about term-indexed datatypes?  What extensions to System~\Fw\ are
needed to embed term-indices as well as type-indices?  Our answer is
System~\Fi.

\index{vector}
In a functional language supporting term-indexed datatypes, we envisage
that the classic example of homogeneous length-indexed lists would be
defined along the following lines (in Nax-like syntax):\begin{singlespace}
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily\small},language=Haskell]
   data Nat = S Nat | Z 
   data Vec : * -> Nat -> * where
     VCons : a -> Vec a {i} -> Vec a {S i}
     VNil  : Vec a {Z}
\end{lstlisting}\end{singlespace}
Here the type constructor~{\tt Vec} is defined to admit parameterisation
by both a type parameter and a term index.\footnote{Recall,
	in Chapter \ref{ch:mendler}, we classify the arguments of
	type constructors either as parameters,
	which appear uniformly in the datatype definition
	(\eg, \texttt{a} in \texttt{Vec}, or as indices,
	which vary (\eg, \texttt{i}, \texttt{S i}, \texttt{Z}).
	Type arguments are sometimes used as parameters and sometimes
	used as as indices. Term arguments, on the other hand, are
	almost always used as indices, except for some degenerate cases
	(\eg, term-indexing by a unit value).}
For instance, the type (\texttt{\small Vec\,(List\;Nat)\,\{S(S\;Z)\}}) is
a vector whose elements are lists of natural numbers. By design, our syntax
directly reflects the difference between type arguments and term arguments
by enclosing the latter in curly braces. We also make this distinction
in System~\Fi, where it is useful within the type system to guarantee
the static nature of term-indexing.

The encoding of the vector datatype in System~\Fi\ is as follows:\vspace*{-3pt}
\begin{equation*}\label{FiVecType}
\texttt{{Vec}}
\triangleq
\begin{array}[t]{l}
\lambda A^{*}.\lambda
i^{\texttt{{Nat}}}.  \forall X^{\texttt{{Nat}}\to *}.
  (\forall j^{\texttt{{Nat}}}.A\to X\{j\}\to X\{\texttt{{S}}\; j\})
  \to X\{\texttt{{Z}}\}
    \to X\{i\}
\end{array}
\end{equation*}\vskip-1ex\noindent
where $\texttt{{Nat}}$, $\mathtt Z$, and $\mathtt S$ respectively encode
the natural number type and its two constructors,  zero and successor.
Again, the term encodings for {\small\tt VCons} and {\small\tt VNil} are exactly
the same as the encodings for {\small\tt Cons} and {\small\tt Nil},
but have different types.

Without going into the details of the formalism, which are given in the
next section, one sees that such a calculus incorporating term-indexing
structure needs four additional constructs (see \Fig{Fi} for the
highlighted extended syntax).
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
  Type-indexed kinding~($A\to\kappa$), as in $(\texttt{{Nat}\ensuremath{\to}*})$
  in the example above, where the compile-time nature of term-indexing
  will be reflected in the typing rules, enforcing that $A$ be a closed
  type~(rule~$(Ri)$ in \Fig{Fi2}).

\item 
  Term-index abstraction~$\lambda i^A.F$~(as
  $\lambda i^{\texttt{{Nat}}}.\cdots$ in the example above) for constructing
  (or introducing) term-indexed kinds (rule~$(\lambda i)$ in \Fig{Fi2}).

\item 
  Term-index application~$F\{s\}$ (as $X\{{\tt Z}\}$, $X\{j\}$, and
  $X\{\texttt{S}\;j\}$ in the example above) for destructing (or
  eliminating) term-indexed kinds, where the compile-time nature of
  indexing will be reflected in the typing rules, enforcing that the index be
  statically typed (rule~$(@i)$ in \Fig{Fi2}).

\item 
  Term-index polymorphism~$\forall i^A.B$~(as
  $\forall j^{\texttt{{Nat}}}.\cdots$ in the example above)
  where the compile-time nature of polymorphic term-indexing
  will be reflected in the typing rules enforcing that the variable~$i$
  be static of closed type~$A$~(rule~$(\forall Ii)$ in \Fig{Fi2}).
\end{enumerate}

As described above, System~\Fi\ maintains a clear-cut separation between
type-indexing and term-indexing.  This adds a level of abstraction
to System~\Fw\ and yields types that in addition to parametric polymorphism
also keep track of inductive invariants using term-indices. All term-index
information can be erased, since it is only used at compile-time.  
It is possible to project any well-typed System~\Fi\ term into
a well-typed System~\Fw\ term.
For instance, the erasure of the \Fi-type~\texttt{Vec}
is the \Fw-type~\texttt{List}.  This is established in
\S\ref{sec:fi:theory} and used to deduce the strong normalization of
System~\Fi.
