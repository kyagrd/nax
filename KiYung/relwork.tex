\subsection{A Summary of Studies on the Mendler style}
\label{sec:relwork:mendler}

\citet{Mendler87} discovered an interesting way of formalizing
primitive recursion, which was later dubbed ``the Mendler-style'',
while he was formalizing a logic that extended System \textsf{F} with
primitive recursion. Interestingly, Mendler did not seem to notice
(or maybe, just did not bother to mention) that his style of formalizing
primitive recursion also guaranteed normalization for non-positive recursive
types -- Mendler required recursive types to be positive in his extension of
System \textsf{F}. A decade later, \citet{matthes98phd} and \citet{uustalu98phd}
noticed that Mendler never used the positivity condition in his proof of
strong normalization.

\citet{AbeMat04} generalized Mendler's primitive recursion combinator
\cite{Mendler87} into a family of combinators that are uniformly defined for
type constructors of arbitrary kinds. This was necessary for
handling nested datatypes. Their system extends System \Fw\ 
(\citet{Mendler87} extends System \textsf{F}). The notion
of a kind indexed family of Mendler combinators has now become the norm.

\citet{AbeMat04} prove strong normalization of their language \textsf{MRec},
which extends System \Fw by adding a family of kind-indexed Mendler-style
primitive recursion combinators. They show that \textsf{MRec} has
a reduction preserving embedding into a calculus they call \Fixw.
Then, they show that \Fixw\ is strongly normalizing.

Abel, Matthes, and Uustalu \cite{AbeMatUus03,AbeMatUus05} studied
a kind-indexed family of iteration combinators, along with examples
involving nested datatypes that make use of those combinators.
Iteration (\aka\ catamorphism) is a recursion scheme, which has the same
computational power as primitive recursion (\ie, both can be defined
in terms of each other), but has different algorithmic complexity. 

It is strongly believed that primitive recursion is more efficient than
iteration. For instance, it is trivial to define a constant time predecessor
for natural numbers with primitive recursion, but it is believed impossible
to define the constant time predecessor with iteration. The Mendler-style
iteration family can be embedded into \Fw\ in a reduction preserving manner.
That is, we can encode the family of Mendler-style iteration combinators
into \Fw\ in such a way that the number of reduction steps of the original
and the embedding differ only by a constant number of steps. The primitive
recursion family, in contrast, is not believed to have a reduction preserving
embedding into \Fw. \citet{AbeMat04} needed a more involved embedding of
\textsf{MRec} into \Fixw, which has a richer structure than \Fw.

Although Matthes, Uustalu, and others, were well aware of the fact that
the Mendler-style iteration family and the primitive-recursion family both
normalize for negative recursive types, they did not explore or document actual
examples. They postponed ``the search for exciting examples of negative
recursive types" until another time. They stated that the normalization
of negative types ``may have a theoretical value
only''\cite{UusVen99}. So, until recently, the study on Mendler-style recursion
combinators focused on examples of positive recursive types with type (rather than term) based indexing.
