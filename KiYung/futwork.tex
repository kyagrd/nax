{\bf {\it MOVED FROM ICFP paper}}
The motivation for this investigation is the design of Trellys, a
full-featured language with dependent types being developed by a
cooperative project of Portland State University, the University of Iowa,
and the University of Pennsylvania. A design goal of Trellys is to develop
an inference mechanism which determines what terms of the language are safe
to use as a logic, and what terms can only be used as programs. We call
this analysis {\em logicality inference}. The intent is that logical values
can be interpreted as proof objects by a Curry-Howard style interpretation,
while programmatic values are allowed to express arbitrary computations
(including non-termination). The usability of Trellys requires that it be
as expressive as possible over natural forms of inductive and recursive
argument.  Hence our motivation to fully understand the Mendler-style
recursion combinators. It is our intention that the three conventions
discussed in the previous paragraph will be enforced in the Trellys system, and
our use of Haskell to illustrate the Mendler style, will soon be unnecessary.
