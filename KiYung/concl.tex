\section{Summary}
Our thesis is that a language design based on
\emph{Mendler-style recursion schemes} and \emph{term-indexed types}
can lead to a system in \emph{the sweet spot} that seamlessly unify
functional programming and logical reasoning
(via the Curry--Howard correspondence).
In Chapter\ref{ch:intro}, we characterized \emph{the sweet spot} by
the four features that the unified language system should support.
They are: (1) a \emph{convenient programming style},
(2) an \emph{expressive logic}, (3) a \emph{small theory}, and
(4) a \emph{small implementation framework}.
