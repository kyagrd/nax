\chapter{System \Fixi}\label{ch:fixi}

It is known that there cannot be a reduction-preserving embedding of
primitive recursion\footnote{
	Although we can define primitive recursion for positive datatypes
	in terms of iteration, which is embeddable in System \F, such an
	embedding would not reduction-preserving. That is, it will take
	more reduction steps than the usual definition of primitive recursion.
	}
in System \F, as suggested by the paper 
{\it Induction is not derivable in second-order dependent type theory}
\cite{Geuvers01}. For similar reasons, it is also strongly believed that
there cannot be a reduction-preserving embedding of primitive recursion 
in System \Fw. \citet{AbeMat04} designed \Fixw, which is an extension of \Fw,
in order to embed primitive recursion with its desired reduction behavior.
Their embedding relys on a novel use of the new extensions to \Fixw,
polarized kinds and an equi-recursive fixpoint type operator,
in order to define primitive recursion within \Fixw.

As a natural extension of these ideas, we present \Fixi,
an extension of \Fixw\ with erasable term-indices,
to embed primitive recursion over term-indexed datatypes
as well as type-indexed datatypes and regular datatypes.

The organization of this chapter is analogous to Chapter \ref{ch:fi}, 
where we added term-indices to \Fw\ to obtain \Fi. Here
we add term indices to \Fixw\ to obtain \Fixi. We describe \Fixi\ focusing on
its differences from \Fi. Readers may refer back to Chapter \ref{ch:fi} for
those details that remain unchanged from System~\Fi.

We describe syntax and typing rules (\S\ref{sec:fixi:def}),
we illustrate embeddings of primitive recursion (\S\ref{sec:fixi:data})
and we discuss embeddings of course-of-values primitive recursion
(\S\ref{sec:fixi:cv}). Lastly, we
discuss the metatheory of \Fixi\ (\S\ref{sec:fixi:theory}).
