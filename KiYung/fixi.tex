\chapter{System \Fixi}\label{ch:fixi}

It is known that primitive recursion is not embeddable in System \F\ since
induction is not derivable in second-order dependent type theory
\cite{Geuvers01}. For similar reasons, it is strongly believed that
primitive recursion is not embeddable in System \Fw. 
\citet{AbeMat04} designed \Fixw, an extension of \Fw\ with polarized kinds and
equi-recursive fixpoint type operator, in order to embed primitive recursion
over regular datatypes and type-indexed datatypes.
We present \Fixi, an extension of \Fixw\ with erasable term-indices,
to embed primitive recursion over term-indexed datatypes.

The organization of this chapter is analogous to the chapter on System \Fi\
(Chapter \ref{ch:fi}). Since the extensions from \Fixw\ to \Fixi\ is
basically the same as the extensions from \Fw\ to \Fi,
the description for \Fixi\ will be focused on the differences between \Fi.
Readers may refer back to Chapter \ref{ch:fi} for the details that are
in common with System~\Fi.

We describe syntax and typing rules (\S\ref{sec:fixi:def}),
illustrate embeddings of primitive recursion (\S\ref{sec:fixi:data})
and discuss embeddings of course-of-values primitive recursion
(\S\ref{sec:fixi:cv}) for term-indexed datatypes. Lastly, we
discuss the metatheory of \Fixi\ (\S\ref{sec:fixi:theory}).
