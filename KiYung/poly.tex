\chapter{Polymorphic type systems}\label{ch:poly}
We review the simply-typed lambda calculus (\S\ref{sec:stlc}),
a non-polymorphic type system, and
a series of well-known polymorphic type systems:
System~\F\ (\S\ref{sec:f}), System~\Fw\ (\S\ref{sec:fw}),
and the Hindley-Milner type system (\S\ref{sec:hm}).
We review them because \Fi\ (Chapter \ref{ch:fi}),
\Fixi\ (Chapter \ref{ch:fixi}), and the Nax language (Chapter \ref{ch:nax})
in later chapters are extensions of these systems. We assume the reader has
some familiarity with lambda calculi, at least with the untyped lambda calculus.

Readers who are not interested in reviewing these type systems,
either because not being interested in theories
or because already having expert-level understanding of the subject,
may skip this chapter.

One of the purposes of this chapter is illustrating
the strong normalization theorem for less common formulations of
the polymorphic lambda calculi. System~\F\ and System~\Fw\ are more often
formulated in Church style and with a single typing context. Here,
we illustrate them in Curry style and their typing rules with two
typing contexts, because our indexed type theories, System~\Fi\ and
System~\Fixi, in Part~\ref{part:Calculi} are formulated in such ways.

Another purpose of this chapter is familiarize the readers with
functional encodings of datatypes in polymorphic type systems
(see \S\ref{sec:f:data} and \S\ref{sec:fw:data}).
