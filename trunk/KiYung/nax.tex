\chapter{The Nax language}\label{ch:nax} TODO

I am also designing a surface language called Nax that supports
non-recursive datatypes, a recursive type operator $\mu$, and
Mendler-style recursion combinators as language constructs.
Nax supports Hindley-Milner style type inference, with a few type annotations
for indexed types. Nax is designed to be embeddable into System \Fi.
You can find a summary of our progress in defining Nax in \S\ref{sec:Nax}.
