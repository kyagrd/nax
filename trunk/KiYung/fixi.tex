\chapter{System \Fixi}\label{ch:fixi}

It is known that primitive recursion cannot be efficiently encoded in System \F.
See the paper 
{\it Induction is not derivable in second-order dependent type theory}
\cite{Geuvers01} for a good explanation. For similar reasons, it is also strongly believed that
primitive recursion cannot be efficiently encoded in System \Fw. 
\citet{AbeMat04} designed \Fixw, an extension of \Fw\ in order to efficiently
encode primitive recursion
over regular datatypes and type-indexed datatypes. Their
encoding relys on a novel use of
polarized kinds and
an equi-recursive fixpoint type operator to  express the encoding.

As a natural extension of these ideas, we present \Fixi, an extension of \Fixw\ with erasable term-indices,
to embed primitive recursion over term-indexed datatypes.

The organization of this chapter is analogous to Chapter \ref{ch:fi}, 
where we added term indices to \Fw\ to obtain \Fi. Here
we add term indices to \Fixw\ to obtain \Fixi. Our
description for \Fixi\ will focus on the differences between \Fi\ and \Fixi.
Readers may refer back to Chapter \ref{ch:fi} for those details that remain
unchanged from System~\Fi.

We describe syntax and typing rules (\S\ref{sec:fixi:def}),
we illustrate embeddings of primitive recursion (\S\ref{sec:fixi:data})
and we discuss embeddings of course-of-values primitive recursion
(\S\ref{sec:fixi:cv}). Lastly, we
discuss the metatheory of \Fixi\ (\S\ref{sec:fixi:theory}).
