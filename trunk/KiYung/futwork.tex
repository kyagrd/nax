Different formalisms different kind of monotonicity

In Chapter \ref{ch:fixi}, we discussed that one may need
different types of monotonicity witness for different datatypes,
even for the same recursion scheme.
For Mendler-style course-of-values recursion (\McvPr),
we have investigated some examples indicating that
truly nested datatypes (\eg, Bush) need stronger notion of
monotonicity witness than other nested datatypes (\eg, Powl).
