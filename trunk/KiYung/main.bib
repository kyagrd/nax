 abstract =	"Nested datatypes are families of datatypes that are
 indexed over all types such that the constructors may
 relate different family members (unlike the homogeneous
 lists). Moreover, the argument types of the
 constructors refer to indices given by expressions
 where the family name may occur. Especially in this
 case of true nesting, termination of functions that
 traverse these data structures is far from being
 obvious. A joint article with A. Abel and T. Uustalu
 (TCS 333(1-2), pp. 3-66, 2005) proposes iteration
 schemes that guarantee termination not by structural
 requirements but just by polymorphic typing. They are
 generic in the sense that no specific syntactic form of
 the underlying datatype {"}functor{"} is required.
 However, there was no induction principle for the
 verification of the programs thus obtained although
 they are well-known in the usual model of initial
 algebras on endofunctor categories. The new
 contribution is a representation of nested datatypes in
 intensional type theory (more specifically, in the
 Calculus of Inductive Constructions) that is still
 generic and covers true nesting, guarantees termination
 of all expressible programs and has an induction
 principle that allows to prove functoriality of
 monotonicity witnesses (maps for nested datatypes) and
 naturality properties of iteratively defined
 polymorphic functions.",

 abstract = {Folds and unfolds are at the heart of the algebra of programming. They allow the cognoscenti to derive and manipulate programs rigorously and effectively. Fundamental laws such as fusion codify basic optimisation principles. However, most, if not all, programs require some tweaking to be given the form of an (un-) fold, and thus make them amenable to formal manipulation. In this paper, we remedy the situation by introducing adjoint folds and unfolds. We demonstrate that most programs are already of the required form and thus are directly amenable to manipulation. Central to the development is the categorical notion of an adjunction, which links adjoint (un-) folds to standard (un-) folds. We discuss a number of adjunctions and show that they are directly relevant to programming.},

  container functors (the categorical analogue of W-types) -- and then establish
  that nested strictly positive inductive and coinductive types, which we call
  strictly positive types, exist in any Martin-Löf category. Central to
  our development are the notions of containers and container functors.
  These provide a new conceptual analysis of data structures and
  polymorphic functions by exploiting dependent type theory as a convenient way
  to define constructions in Martin-Löf categories. We also show that
  morphisms between containers can be full and faithfully interpreted as
  polymorphic functions (i.e.  natural transformations) and that,
  in the presence of W-types, all strictly positive types (including
  nested inductive and coinductive types) give rise to containers."
