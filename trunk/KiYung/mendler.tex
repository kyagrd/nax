\chapter{Mendler-style recursion schemes}\label{ch:mendler}

This chapter is a revised and extended version of
my recent work \cite{AhnShe11}.

%% We \cite{AhnShe11} have illustrated that Mendler-style recursion combinators
%% can be defined not only for nested datatypes but also for arbitrary indexed
%% datatypes, whose can index may vary in the result types of the
%% data constructors as well as in the argument types of the data constructors.
%% For example, many examples using Generalized Algebraic DataTypes (GADTs),
%% a popular extension to the type system of Haskell, involves indexed datatypes
%% beyond the scope of nested datatypes.
%% 
%% Previous work, that promoted the expressiveness and generality of
%% the Mendler-style \cite{AbeMatUus03,AbeMatUus05,AbeMat04} used examples
%% involving nested datatypes, a particularly simple kind of indexing
%% where the variation of indices are restricted to the argument types of
%% the data constructors. In order to handle nested datatypes, the translation of
%% the Mendler-style combinators into System \textsf{F}, had to be extended to
%% translation into \Fw. To translate Mendler-style combinators over arbitrary
%% indexed types including term indices we have to extend \Fw, to a new calculus
%% we call \Fi, and prove that this new calculus is also strongly normalizing.
%% I have identified what the extensions must look like and have been developing
%% the theoretical background necessary to accomplish this task.
%% This theory is an important part of the thesis and is elaborated in
%% Chapter \ref{ch:fi}.
%% 
%% Despite, not having a completed theory to support the translation of GADTs,
%% we have identified many examples \cite{AhnShe11}. Including examples
%% that use term indices to exploit the Curry-Howard isomorphism, and
%% examples of mutual recursion (between types) encoded in terms of GADTs.
%% 
%% In general, we have pushed the boundaries of what is known about
%% the Mendler-style operators in many ways. We have identified new domains
%% in which they are applicable, identified new operators, adapted old ones,
%% and organized them all into a natural hierarchy that explains how all are
%% instances of a common pattern. However, we know of no guarantee that every
%% principled recursion scheme has a Mendler-style operator, so there is
%% much work still to be done.
