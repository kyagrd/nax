\subsection{Proposal}
\label{Proposal}

\paragraph*{General aim.}

Headed by Principal Investigator Marcelo Fiore, the project builds a group
of international world-leading experts in theoretical and applied computer
science.  The team will be dedicated to combined research in Category
Theory, Mathematical Logic, Programming Theory, and Type Theory.
Specifically, to understand and develop formal languages and mathematical
models for computer programming and mathematical proof. 

\paragraph*{Working thesis.}

The research is driven by the thesis that
\begin{myquote}
\item
Languages for computer programming and languages for mathematical proof are of
the same character.
\end{myquote}
This view was first developed in the 1960s and is now central to research in
programming languages and constructive mathematics.

An aspect of the thesis that is fundamental to us here is typically referred
to as the Proofs-as-Programs or Propositions-as-Types correspondence.  It can
be impressionistically presented as follows
\[
  \mbox{proof : Proposition} 
  \enspace \approx \enspace 
  \mbox{program : Type} 
\]
and is intuitively explained along these lines: to give a constructive proof
of a proposition is to construct a program that certifies the statement, while
to type a program is to establish a property of that program.

Research stemming from the Propositions-as-Types correspondence has been very
fruitful.  Many of its mathematical theories have been implemented as computer
systems, and used academically and industrially.  Cases in point are:
programming languages for high-assurance code and proof assistants for
computer-aided verification; examples are Haskell, %~\cite{Haskell} 
an industrial-strength functional programming language, and Coq, %~\cite{Coq} 
a proof assistant in which bodies of mathematics are being verified.

\paragraph*{The future.}

Transferring mathematical theories to computer systems has required both
technical/theoretical and technological/applied progress.  This has
necessarily demanded increasingly specialised, and to some extent fragmentary,
research.  Importantly, the field has reached a first plateau; encompassing a
substantial body of work and expertise.  How will it continue to advance?  By
considering new directions and challenges, of course.  But, it is our firm
view that it will be essential to do so generating questions and tackling
problems from the perspectives of a variety of research areas.  Both of these
aspects are put forward here.

\paragraph*{Our philosophy.}

Two disciplines are clearly involved in investigating the Proofs-as-Programs 
correspondence: Mathematical Logic and Programming Theory.  This is only half
of the picture.  The full picture also involves Type Theory and Category
Theory.  Figure~\ref{ResearchAreas} 
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}
gives a schematic view of the interactions between these four research areas
in this context.  Each of them is complementary to the others.  Together, as a
unified whole, they have shaped fields of computer science and mathematics.
It is within this framework that we propose cross-cutting research in Category
Theory, Mathematical Logic, Programming Theory, and Type Theory.  We contend
that an approach neglecting any one of them is to the detriment of the others;
missing the depth and richness of the subject and, crucially, missing
opportunities for research and development.  

\paragraph*{Main goals.}

The motivations for our research proposal are specifically: 
\begin{myitemize}
\item[\raisebox{.75mm}{\tiny$\bigstar$}]\hspace*{-2mm}
  To identify the next-generation framework of Type Theory relevant to
  computer science and mathematics.
\item[\raisebox{.75mm}{\tiny$\bigstar$}]\hspace*{-2mm}
  To exercise and test Category Theory both as a unifying and as a
  foundational mathematical language.
\item[\raisebox{.75mm}{\tiny$\bigstar$}]\hspace*{-2mm}
  To broaden the current role of Mathematical Logic in computation.
\item[\raisebox{.75mm}{\tiny$\bigstar$}]\hspace*{-2mm}
  To design, implement, and experiment within Programming Theory, looking
  into the languages of the future.
\end{myitemize}

We particularly aim to contribute with: a framework to analyse and synthesise
type theories; mathematical theories and models for varieties of computational
phenomena; formal calculi for proof and/or computation; and experimental
high-level programming languages.

\paragraph*{Research programme.}

The research programme has been precisely conceived to target the goals
above.  It is organised in four strands as outlined below.
\begin{myitemize}
\item[{\bfseries 1\enspace Foundations:}]\mbox{}\enspace\thinspace 
  \emph{A comprehensive research programme on the metamathematics of type
    theories.}

  \vspace*{1mm}
  We will address the fundamental question of what type theories are, which
  will also lead us to rethink them.  Our approach aims at an algebraic
  framework that will generalise to type theories all aspects of our current
  understanding of algebraic theories.  The scale at which this will be
  attempted this is unprecedented, systematically exploring a wide spectrum of
  key type-theoretic features.
  \vspace*{1mm}

\item[{\bfseries 2\enspace Models:}]\mbox{}\enspace\thinspace
  \emph{Study of mathematical models for type theories and logical systems.}

  \vspace*{1mm}
  We will tackle semantic problems at the forefront of current understanding.
  %
  In the context of type theories, we will conduct investigations
  concerning a main problem in the area: to reconcile extensional equality
  and intensional identity (\ie~the mathematical and computational notions
  of sameness).  
  %
  In the context of logical systems, we will develop both calculi suggested by
  mathematical models and models for so far intractable calculi,
  \eg~encompassing aspects of resource management and computational effects.  
  \vspace*{1mm}%%%HACK!!!
  
\item[{\bfseries 3\enspace Calculi:}]\mbox{}\enspace\thinspace
  \emph{Development of formalisms of deduction as internal languages of
    mathematical models.}
  
  \vspace*{1mm}
  We will aim at evolving the term and type structure of current type
  theories, which in essence has not changed since the late 1960s.  Pursuing
  the view that evolution will come from mathematical input, we will
  research type theories as formal languages of (higher-dimensional)
  categorical structures.  
  \vspace*{1mm}

\item[{\bfseries 4\enspace Programming:}]\mbox{}\enspace\thinspace
  \emph{Design and implementation of novel computational languages.}

  \vspace*{1mm}
  Guided by mathematical theories and pragmatics, we will look into the
  engineering of principles and concepts for programming, exporting them to
  language designs and implementations.  We will specifically consider
  experimental languages, \eg~supporting indexed data structures,
  computational effects, and metaprogramming.  
\end{myitemize}

\paragraph*{The team.}

The research team will be led by Principal Investigator~(PI) \emph{Marcelo
Fiore} (%Computer Laboratory, 
University of Cambridge): 
    a leading expert in applications of category theory to computer science,
    including abstract algebra, concurrency theory, programming-language
    semantics, sheaf theory, and type theory.  
He will be backed up by an international group of three Senior Visiting
Researchers~(SVRs): \emph{Pierre-Louis Curien} (%Laboratoire PPS, 
Univerist\'e Paris Diderot - Paris~7): 
  a leading expert in programming-language semantics, with contributions into
  category theory, logic, %rewriting theory, 
  and type theory; 
  \emph{Peter Dybjer} (%Department of Computer Science, 
Chalmers University of Technology): 
  a leading expert in type theory, including its connections with category
  theory and logic, and its implementation in proof assistants; and 
  \emph{Tim Sheard} (%Department of Computer Science, 
Portland State University): 
  a leading expert in pro\-gram\-ming-language design and implementation,
  encompassing functional and metaprogramming systems. 
%
The PI is to collaborate with the SVRs by mutual research visits, email, and
conference calls.
%
The team is completed by three outstanding Research Associates~(RAs) to be
based at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, under the PI.  They
are
  \emph{Ki Yung Ahn} (%Department of Computer Science, 
Portland State University): 
  a PhD student of Sheard writing up his dissertation on the design and
  implementation of a language for indexed programming;
  \emph{Nicola Gambino} (%Dipartimento di Matematica e Informatica, 
Universit\`a degli Studi di Palermo):  
  an established researcher in the areas of type theory and category theory,
  with whom the PI has already collaborated; and 
  \emph{Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni} (%Laboratoire PPS, 
Univerist\'e Paris Diderot - Paris~7): 
  a PhD student of Curien writing up his dissertation on the
  Propositions-as-Types correspondence in classical logic.
Currently, the two junior RAs lack future funding.  All RAs would be ready
to join the project from the start.

\subsection{Origins and influences}
\label{Origins}

We sketch the background of our scientific framework.

\paragraph*{Logic and computation.}

Computer science was born as a branch of mathematics, specifically
mathematical logic.  Its inception was Hilbert's %~\cite{?}
Decision Problem, asking whether there is an algorithmic procedure for
deciding mathematical statements.  Negative answers were provided
independently by Church %~\cite{Church1936} 
and Turing, %~\cite{Turing},
giving birth to the mathematical theory of computation.  Their approaches
founded different branches of theoretical computer science.  The line of
development starting with Church's {\lcalculus} %~\cite{?} 
is concerned with prototypical computational languages that are used to study
high-level programming languages.  

\paragraph*{Type theory and logic.}
\label{SectionATypeTheoryAndLogicParagraph}

Type Theory, as we now know it, arose from Church's integration of types into
his \lcalculus, yielding the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus. %~\cite{Church1940}.
This was a natural step under the naive interpretation of
\mbox{$\lambda$-abstraction} as defining functions.  Howard %~\cite{Howard1969}
made a fundamental discovery relating Mathematical Logic to Type Theory in
this context.  This is the Propositions-as-Types correspondence, referred to
in Section~\ref{Proposal}.

In another very important direction, Church introduced a Simple Theory of
Types %~\cite{Church1940} 
as an axiomatization of Higher-Order Logic.  This axiomatization was
formalised within a Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus.  In doing so, he adopted a
radically new perspective, shifting the status of the Simply-Typed Lambda
Calculus from that of a `language' to a `metalanguage'. 

\paragraph*{Category theory, logic, and type theory.}

The connection between Category Theory, Logic, and Type Theory was
initiated by Lawvere %~\cite{LawvereAinF} 
and Lambek. %~\cite{LambekI}. 
%
Lawvere's insight was to understand logical connectives and type constructors
as categorical structures arising from adjoint functors.  It is now
well-understood that the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus with products provides
an internal language for Cartesian Closed Categories: it is the calculus of
all such models.  This view further enriches the Propositions-as-Types
correspondence as into a trinity consisting of Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus
with products, Cartesian Closed Categories, and Propositional Intuitionistic
Logic.

\paragraph*{Type theory and programming.}

The Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus is a prototypical functional programming
language.  In this light, the problem of type inference is of central
practical importance.  Milner %~\cite{Milner1978} 
solved it for the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus with parametric polymorphism.  
 
Polymorphism in programming was introduced by Strachey. %~\cite{Strachey1967}.
Reynolds %~\cite{Reynolds} 
formalised it by introducing the Polymorphic Typed Lambda Calculus.
Strikingly, this system had already been proposed by
Girard %~\cite{GirardSystemF} 
as the type-theoretic counterpart of Second-Order Propositional Logic.  Girard
had also introduced {\SystemFomega}, the type-theoretic counterpart of
Higher-Order Propositional Logic.  {\SystemFomega} lies at the core of the
Haskell programming language. 

These type systems aim at logical foundations and only introduce terminating
computations.  As for Turing complete languages, Scott %~\cite{ScottTCS}
introduced an extension of Typed Combinatory Logic with a fixpoint combinator. 
Plotkin %~\cite{PlotkinLCF} 
studied the calculus as a programming language, and enriched type theory with
concerns from programming: the distinction between call-by-value and
call-by-name. %~\cite{PlotkinCBVCBN}.

\subsection{Questions and pathways for research}

We present the basis for the research methodology and plan outlined in the
next section.

\paragraph*{Foundations.}

Type theories are ubiquitous in computer science and mathematics.  However,
the following fundamental question remains open:
\req{\ref{AlgebraicTypeTheoryParagraph}}
{What is a type theory?}

\paragraph*{Dependent types.}

Dependent type theory was introduced by de~Bruijn. %~\cite{deBruijn} 
It is an extension of simple type theory that allows types to be indexed by
other types.  Such objects abound in computer science and mathematics.  
Two essential constructions on dependent judgements are: dependent sums and
dependent product types.  %(see~\eg~\cite{Jacobs}).  
Under the Propositions-as-Types correspondence, they amount to existential and
universal quantification.  A crucial problem 
is to:
\rep{\ref{IntensionalTypeTheoryParagraph}}
  {Investigate equality and identity in dependent type theory.}

Passing from sum and product types to their dependent versions required new
type theories.  Categorical models suggest generalisations and the following: 
\rep{\ref{CalculiSubsection}}
  {Develop type theories from mathematical models.}

\paragraph*{Mathematical universes.}

The construction of new mathematical universes of discourse from old ones is
basic in semantics.  It is thus natural to ask:
\reqs{\ref{MethodologyMathematicalUniversesParagraph}}
  {What mechanisms are there for changing from a type theory to another one
    as universes of discourse? 
%
%    Can this be done while maintaining the relevant computational properties
%    and then incorporated into mechanical proof assistants?
}

One technique to do so is the presheaf construction.  

\paragraph*{Indexed programming.}

In discrete form, pre\-sheaves can be found in programming languages as
indexed data\-types; programming with which will be referred to as indexed
programming.  

Indexed programming developed from the practical needs of supporting data
structures with strong invariants and the experimentation with
dependently-typed programming languages. %~\cite{Cayenne,Epigram}
These two views pull in opposite directions and lead to conceptually different
languages.  One is lead to investigate the following.
\rep{\ref{IndexedProgrammingParagraph}} 
  {Develop foundational type theories for indexed datatypes.  
   % 
   Design and implement indexed programming languages from these and
   pragmatics.}

\paragraph*{Resources, effects, modalities.}

Girard %~\cite{GirardLinearLogic} and 
Moggi %~\cite{MoggiLambdaC} 
proposed two important analyses of computation, respectively for resources and
effects.  The former in the contexts of logic and proof theory; the latter in
that of denotational semantics and category theory.  Both had tremendous
impact in programming-language theory.  

The predominant model-theoretic view of resources and effects is as
categorical structures arising at opposite sides of an adjunction.  This is
not so in all models and the following remains unanswered.
%
\req{\ref{PolarisationParagraph}}
  {How can resources and effects be reconciled and unified?}
%
The answer seems to involve the logical notion of
polarisation. %~\cite{Andreoli}. 
This enriches the computational scenario with eager \vs~lazy modes of
computation and data structures.  We incorporate this into the following.
%
\rep{\ref{PolarisationParagraph}\,\&\,\ref{ProgrammingEffectsParagraph}}
  {Study and develop the theory of resource management, computational
    effects, and polarisation.  Percolate this down into the design of
    programming languages.}

\paragraph*{Sequent calculi.}

A theme orthogonal to the logics under consideration is whether they are
specified in natural deduction or sequent calculus style. 

Work on the Propositions-as-Types correspondence has focussed on natural
deduction systems, mainly because there is as yet no established syntax for
sequent calculi.  Two questions at the core of this situation are:
%
\reqs{\ref{ProgrammingEffectsParagraph}}
  {What is the categorical algebra of classical sequent calculi? %}
%
%\req{\ref{ProgrammingEffectsParagraph}}
  %{
  What can the proof theory of sequent calculi do for programming?}

\subsection{Research methodology and plan}

We expand the research programme outlined in Section\,\ref{Proposal}, giving
just a taste of the full scientific proposal.

\subsubsection{Foundations}
\label{Foundations}

\paragraph{Algebraic Type Theory.}
\label{AlgebraicTypeTheoryParagraph}

Many-sorted algebra provides the most basic notion of type theory, with no
binding operators and no type constructors.  Its modern understanding is
through an Algebraic Trinity of three interrelated perspectives: Equational
Logic, Categorical Algebra, and Universal Algebra.
%(see~\cite{Birkhoff,LawvereThesis,Linton}).
Each of these approaches gives an important different viewpoint of the
subject.

We will \hl{investigate} an analogous development for varieties of Type
Theory.  To make substantial prog\-ress, we will systematically explore a broad
spectrum of key features present in type theories; to wit, term and type
variable binding with simple, polymorphic, and dependent typing, in
combination with the orthogonal notion of linearity.  

This research rests on fundamental work, old and recent, of
Fiore~\etal\
%~\cite{FiorePlotkinTuri,FioreLICS08,FioreHurLMCS,FioreSecOrdEqLog,FioreMahmoud,FioreICALP2012}.
Two salient \hl{goals} are: To develop a mathematical algebraic framework
for the semantics of language phrases, whereby free models universally
characterise the abstract syntax of the language; and to synthesise
metalanguages for type theories in the form of formal systems for equational
deduction, that are sound and complete for the model theory.  The outcome of
this work will be new unified metamathematical foundations for Type Theory.

\subsubsection{Models}
\label{Models}

\paragraph{Equality and identity in dependent type theory.}
\label{IntensionalTypeTheoryParagraph}

Central to a type theory is its associated equational theory, or judgemental
equality.  In Pure Intensional Type Theory, this is generated by rules of
computation.  Extensional Type Theory refers to extensions of Pure Intensional
Type Theory with extensionality features.  These may be given by weak rules of
extensionality or by a strong rule of equality reflection (of an intensional
notion of equality internal to the type theory as a judgemental equality).  

Conceptually, one may regard a type theory as a deduction system extended with
type constructors.  As such, a type theory is to be thought not just as a
single universe of discourse, but rather as a variety of universes of
discourse.  From this perspective, it is important to understand the
interaction of modularly extending type theories.  A key notion is that of
conservative extension.  Informally, an extension of a type theory is
conservative when it does not modify the judgemental equality of the extended
type theory.

We will pursue \hl{research} on the so far unexplored problem of
conservativity in dependent type theory.  We will \hl{aim} at being
comprehensive, targeting Intensional and Weak/Strong Extensional type theories
with dependent sums, dependent products, inductive types, and universes.  Our
\hl{goal} is to deepen the current understanding of equality/extensionality
and identity/intensionality in type theory via a model-theoretic framework for
conservative extension results.  

The full scientific proposal expands on the above in connection to an
interesting recent approach to extensionality in Martin-L\"of Type Theory,
\viz~Voevodsky's Univalence Axiom. %~\cite{UnivalentProgramme}. 
Those considerations \hl{aim} to investigate a main problem in type
theory: To reconcile Intensional and Extensional Type Theory in a
computational framework.

\paragraph{Mathematical universes.}
\label{MethodologyMathematicalUniversesParagraph}

Our \hl{research} activity centered on exploring new models will investigate
pre\-sheaf, orthogonality, sheaf, glueing, and forcing constructions on type
theories.  Topos Theory %~\cite{Elephant} 
will be used as a main source of inspiration and guidance.  Our \hl{goal}
is to build a mathematical theory of constructions on type theories that
produce new type theories from old ones, together with an interpretation
(or compilation) of the latter into the former.

\paragraph{Polarised logic.}
\label{PolarisationParagraph}

A logical system (or type theory) with explicit polarisation classifies
logical connectives (or type constructors) as either being positive or
negative; with these two worlds being dual to each other (categorically, by
adjunction).  Examples are the Girard's logic~{\LC} %~\cite{GirardLC} 
and Levy's Call-By-Push-Value calculus. %~\cite{LevyCBPV}.

A distinguishing aspect of polarised calculi is that they make call-by-value
(or eager) and call-by-name (or lazy) modes of computation explicit, allowing
for their combination in a framework with eager and lazy data structures.

Our investigations in this context will \hl{aim} at a model-theoretic study of
a rich variety of calculi encompassing aspects of resource management
(categorically, comonadic structure) %~\cite{Seely}) 
and computational effects (categorically, monadic 
structure) %~\cite{MoggiLambdaC})
as informed by polarisation.

Details of the models to be considered are in the full scientific proposal.
Here let us just mention that they subsume 
%
Girard's Intuitionistic Linear Logic; %~\cite{GirardLinearLogic};
%
Levy's Call-By-Push-Value; %~\cite{LevyCBPV};
%
Egger, M{\o}gelberg, and Simpson's Enriched Effect Calculus; %~\cite{EEC}
and
%
Melli\`es and Tabareau's Tensor Logic. %~\cite{TensorLogic}
%
In fact, we will go far beyond tackling the open \hl{problem} of developing a
model theory for Girard's~\LC.

Importantly, our investigations will target so-called direct-style languages
and models; so that they can directly feed into the proposed research of
Section~\ref{ProgrammingEffectsParagraph}.

\paragraph{Modal logics.}
\label{ModalLogicsParagraph}

Resource comonads and effect monads are logical modalities.  Polarisation in
the general context of modal logic has not been considered yet, and we will
complement the previous studies with the \hl{investigation} of Polarised
Modal Logics.  Our \hl{goal} is to develop the Propositions-as-Types
correspondence for modal logics.  We are specially interested in grounding it
through categorical models, that have been scarcely investigated.

In connection to Section~\ref{MetaprogrammingParagraph}, we will 
consider: 
%
Borghuis' Modal Pure Type Systems; %~\cite{ModalPTS};
%
Artemov's Logic of Proofs %~\cite{ArtemovLP} 
and related systems;
%(\eg~\cite{AltArtemov,ArtemovIemhoff}); 
%Daniyar S Shamkanov: Strong Normalization and Confluence for Reflexive
%  Combinatory Logic 
%
Mendler's Multimodal $CK$; %~\cite{MendlerMMCK};
and
%
Park and Im's Calculus $S_\Delta$. %~\cite{ParkIm}.

\subsubsection{Calculi}
\label{CalculiSubsection}

\paragraph*{Categorical Type Theory.}

We propose two lines of \hl{research} aimed at developing type-theoretic
formalisms as languages for categorical structures.

\paragraph{Generalised Type Theory.}
\label{GeneralisedTypeTheoryParagraph}

We will consider Lawvere's Generalised Logical Calculus, %~\cite{LawvereMetric},
synthesised by him from the model of presheaves in enriched category theory.
Our \hl{goal} will be to develop a type theory providing a
Propositions-as-Types interpretation of the Generalised Logical Calculus.
Success will yield a system where mathematical calculations in enriched
category theory can be established formally.  The problem of automating it
will be investigated.

The central novel constructions of the Generalised Logical Calculus are
so-called coends and ends.  Intuitively, these are quotients of dependent sums
and restrictions of dependent products.  Taking this view seriously, we will
\hl{aim} to extend the above to a fully-fledged, possibly
higher-dimensional, dependent type theory.  

\paragraph{Directed Type Theory.}
\label{DirectedTypeTheoryParagraph}

Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) refers to a body of work at the boundary between
Homotopy Theory and Dependent Type Theory through Martin-L\"of's Identity
Types. %~\cite{ProgMLTT}.  
In a related vein, our \hl{aim} is to discover a notion of Directed Type
connecting Higher-Dimensional Category Theory and Dependent Type Theory on
which to establish a body of work on Directed Type Theory (DiTT).  Our
\hl{motivation} for this comes from computation.  Indeed, while Identity
Types establish the intentional equality of elements in a type, Directed Types
would instead represent the ways in which an element of a type may evolve to
another one in a possibly irreversible manner.  The full scientific proposal
includes preliminary thoughts for development in this direction.

\subsubsection{Programming}
\label{Programming}

We will design and implement programming languages from first principles and
pragmatics, following this up by their subsequent test, use, and distribution.
The research directions below will be considered as units in their own right,
and in relation to each other.

\paragraph{Indexed programming.}
\label{IndexedProgrammingParagraph}

Our main \hl{goal} here is to design/implement a language for programming
indexed data structures that will inform the design/implementation of the next
generation of programming languages.  To this end, we will pursue
\hl{research} in a bottom-up fashion, an approach that in this context has not
been explored systematically, extending functional programming languages with
indexing structure as prescribed by foundational calculi.

Under the Propositions-as-Types paradigm, we \hl{aim} at a language
supporting the activity of proving properties as a by-product of programming,
rather than that of extracting programs from the activity of proving
properties.  A strong pragmatic reason for this is that our uppermost interest
is in a language for programmers. 

An important \hl{challenge} to be faced is to design language constructs
with minimal type annotation that support maximal type inference.  Indeed,
this is a main open problem in dependently-typed programming language theory.

\paragraph{Effects.}
\label{ProgrammingEffectsParagraph}

Our overall \hl{aim} is to consider the model-theoretic investigations of
Section~\ref{PolarisationParagraph} from a proof-theoretic viewpoint and
percolate them down to programming language theory.

A main \hl{novelty} of our approach is that the proof theory to be
considered is based on sequent calculus, rather than the traditional line
followed so far in programming-language foundations based on sequent-style
natural deduction.  This requires the use and further investigation of an
emerging formalism, currently referred to as the calculus or system~\SysL,
that is proving robust in applications.

The research will require theoretical and applied work.  Theoretically, our
\hl{goal} will be to establish a Propositions-as-Types trinity between
classical sequent calculi and computational languages with effects and rich
type structure through adjoint interpretations.  Practically, we will need to
address a crucial programming-language \hl{question}:  What is the
programming paradigm stemming from sequent calculi in general, and the
calculus~\SysL\ in particular? 

As for polarisation, we believe that programmers will be able to intuitively
assimilate the eager {\vs}~lazy modes of computation and data structures
underlying it.  But, pragmatically, we will need to \hl{investigate} the
kind of programming style and language that will easily allow a programmer to
code polarisation.

The full scientific proposal contains further considerations on \hl{research}
possibilities for system~\SysL\ in programming and for effects encompassing
control.

\paragraph{Metaprogramming.}

%\subsection*{\S\enspace\thinspace Personal statement}

My research is in theoretical computer science, and by its own nature develops
in the context of close specialised collaboration.  My work stems from the
interaction between two approaches: abstract and concrete. At the abstract
level, I build mathematical theories. At the concrete level, theories are
applied to specific problems. This duality has yielded deep results and
provided research breadth, giving fundamental contributions to a variety of
fields and finding connections among them; \eg~domain theory, category theory,
concurrency theory, sheaf theory, type theory, logic, algebra.  Indeed,
note that I publish in computer science and mathematics venues, and I have
been invited speaker at both computer science and mathematics meetings.
My \mbox{h-index} is 21, according to Google scholar.
