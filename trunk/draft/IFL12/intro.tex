\section{Introduction}
During the past decade, the functional programming community achieved
partial success in their goal of maintaining fine-grained properties
by moderate extensions to the type system of functional languages
\cite{CheHin03,CheHin02,Xi03}.
This approach is often called \emph{``lightweight''}\footnote{e.g.,
  \url{http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/lightweight-dependent-typing.html} }
in contrast to proof assistant based on a fullly dependent types
(\eg, Coq, Agda).
The Generalized Algebraic Data Type (GADT) extension implemented
in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) has promoted the lightweight approach
widely avialibe to everyday functional programming tasks.
OCaml encodings of GADTs has been reported \cite{ManStu09}
and recent versions of OCaml supports GADTs natively \cite{GarNor11}.

Unfortunately, most practical language implementations that support
the lightweight approach lack \textbf{logical consistency} and
\textbf{type inference}. In addtion, they often lack support for
term indexing, so \textbf{term indices are faked} (or, simulated)
by additional type structure replicating the requisite term structure.
A recent extension in GHC, datatype promotion, attempts to address
the issue of term indices, but the issuses of logical consistency
and type inference still remain.

\item[$(1)$ Nax is strongly normalizing and logically consistent.]~\\
Types in Nax programs can be given logical interpretations as propositions
and the Nax programs can be interpreted as proofs. TODO Mendler-style

\item[$(2)$ Nax supports Hindley--Milner-style type inference.]~\\
Type annotations only appear in the data declarations and
the index transformers attached to Mendler-style recursion combinators
(for recursive values) and case expresssions (for non-recursive values).
Index transformers are the ``minimal''  annotation necessary to support
type inference over programs involving GADTs. Nax does not need annotations
for every the top-level functions, which are usually required for
bidirectional type checking [TODO cite] used in dependnelty typed
proof assistants.

\item[$(3)$ Nax programs are expressive and concise.]~\\
Nax programs are similar in size to their Haskell and Agda equivalents,
yet they still retain logicality and type inference. We don't pay for the
complexity of two level types and mendler morphisms.
