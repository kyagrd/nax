\section{Summary and Ongoing Work} \label{sec:concl}
System~\Fi\ is a strongly-normalizing, logically-consistent, higher-order
polymorphic lambda calculus that was designed to support the
definition of datatypes indexed by both terms and types.
In terms of expressivity, System~\Fi\ sits between System~\Fw\ and ICC.
We designed System~\Fi\ as a tool to reason about programming
languages with term-indexed datatypes. System \Fi\ can express
large class of term-indexed datatypes, even including nested term
indices.

One limitation of System \Fi\ is that it cannot express type level
data structures such as lists that contain type elements (\eg,
$[\textit{Bool}, \textit{Int}, \textit{Int} -> \textit{Bool}]$).
We envision to overcome this limitation by designing an extension of \Fi\
with first-class datatype descriptions \cite{DagMcb12}, which reflects
the structure of types at term level.

We are designing and implementing the Nax programming language
\cite{TODO cite Nax}, which is based on System \Fi.
Nax is given semantics in terms of System~\Fi.
That is, all the primitive language constructs of Nax
that are not present in \Fi\ have translations into System \Fi.
Such constructs include Mendler-style recursion combinators,
recursive type operator, pattern matching and case expressions.

talk about need of more recursion schemes and extension of Fi such as Fixi
