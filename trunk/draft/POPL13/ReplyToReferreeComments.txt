Thanks for the many fine comments

1) We agree with the comments mentioning that most proofs should be
omitted and that the real (as opposed to rough) statements should be
given.  In this respect, we would like to promise that the paper will
be revised accordingly.  

2)
Some referees want more motivation and [real]
examples.  Some of this could be included in the reply with the
promise of more to follow in the revised paper; though I don't know
whether the reply allows enough space to do this.  There are a lots of
other little points that could and should be addressed, but I guess
that not much can be done at this point and they are to remain as

3) We would like to address a few of the comments made by referree #57B.

This is clearly a misunderstanding!  \Delta is a context
and so cannot have A^* for a closed type A!  (Taking instead \Delta =
X^*, i^A the property holds.)

The referee claims

(1)  \Delta^\dot,\Gamma = i^A

while a simple application of the ^\bullet definition gives

  \Delta^\dot = i:A

Moreover, even if (1) were the case, the further claim of the referee that

  (\Delta^\dot,\Gamma)^\circle = i^(A^\circle)

amounts to

  (i^A)^\circ = i^A

is wrong by the very definition of ^\circ.
