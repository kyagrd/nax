\section{Conclusion and Future work}
\label{sec:concl}

System~\Fi\ is a strongly-normalizing, logically-consistent, higher-order
polymorphic lambda calculus that was designed to support the
definition of datatypes indexed by both terms and types.
In terms of expressivity, System~\Fi\ sits between System~\Fw\ and ICC.
We designed System~\Fi\ as a tool to reason about programming
languages with term-indexed datatypes. 

We have applied this tool to the design of the programming language Nax (not yet published).
Nax is given semantics in terms of System~\Fi . In Nax, Mendler style operators
are primitive operators with their own typing rules. Nax has been designed to
be expressive over the Hindley-Milner subset of System \Fi. It supports type
inference with minimal typing annotations. We believe this is an advantage
made possible because our extensions to \Fw\ are all static. This would be made
much more difficult had we restricted ICC.

Typing annotations are necessary only
on case statements (for non-recursive term-indexed datatypes)
and Mendler style operators (for recursive term-indexed datatypes).
Programs involving only type-indexing require no annotations.
A typing annotation takes the form of a large elimination --
an abstraction over both types and terms to types. Such abstractions
are classified exactly by the kinds derivable from the kind
syntax of \Fi.   The current implementation requires
static annotations, but we believe we can extend Nax to abstract over
annotations, and still retain the strict separation between terms and types
that allows both type inference and an erasure semantics.
