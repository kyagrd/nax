\begin{abstract}

We are interested in incorporating dependent types in ordinary programming
languages. We are interested in two kinds of dependent types.
Full dependency, where the type of a function can depend upon the value
of its run-time parameters, and static dependency, where the type
of a function can depend only upon static (or compile-time parameters).
Static dependency is sometimes called indexed types. The first
is very expressive, but the second is often much easier to learn to
use. Index types come in two flavors: (1) type indexed and (2) term
indexed types. Type indexing includes parametric polymorphism, but it also
includes more sophisticated typing such as Generalized Algebraic Datatypes
(GADTs). Term indexed types include indices that range over data strutures,
such as the Natural Numbers (like {\tt Zero}, {\tt (Succ Zero)}) or 
Lists (like {\tt Nil} or {\tt (Cons 1 Nil)}) rather than types such as {\tt Int}. The classic example of a term index
is the second parameter to the length-indexed list type {\tt (Vector Int (Succ Zero))}. In languages
such as Haskell, which support GADTs, term-indices are ``faked" by reflecting
``data" at the type level with uninhabited type constructors.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce a foundational type system, \Fi,  for
the design of programming languages with term-indexed data types which avoids
reflecting data. To do this, we have devised a minimal extension of System
\Fw\ that incorporates term indices. While term-indexed datatypes are expressible
in richer systems, such as the Implicit Calculus Constructions (ICC),
such systems come coupled with orthogonal features
such as large eliminations and dependent types.
We argue there are important pedagogical benefits of isolating the minimal
features to support term-indexing. We also argue that
System \Fi\ provides a theory for analysing programs with
term-indexed types and provides the basis for the design of light-weight
logically-sound dependent programming languages.

In terms of expressivity, \Fi\ sits in between \Fw\ (the prototypical
logical calculus for functional programming)  and ICC (a full-featured
dependent type theory).  
Indeed, we relate System \Fi\ to \Fw\ and ICC as
follows.  We establish erasure properties of \Fi\
that capture the idea that term indices are discardable 
in that they are irrelevant for computation.  Erased \Fi\ terms are \Fw\
terms; so \Fi inherits the strong-normalisation property from System
\Fw.  On the other hand, the logical consistency of \Fi\ is
established by embedding it into a subset of ICC.
