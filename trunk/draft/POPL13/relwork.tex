In a theorectical setting

All terms typable in System \Fw\ are typable in System \Fi\ with the same type,
and all terms typable in \Fi\ are are typable in ICC with the same type.
So, the subject-reduction property of \Fi\ is automatic from ICC.
ICC\cite{Miquel01} is more than just a dependent extension of \Fi,
as dscribed in our work, since ICC includes $\eta$-reduction and
the extensionality typing rule. We foresee no problem of adding
$\eta$-reduction and the extensionalty typing rule to \Fi.
However, System \Fi\ enjoys the erasure property (TODO internal cite),
which ICC does not have.

Why Curry style is often preferable - better reduction properties.
\citet{Nederpelt73} showed a counterexample that the Church-Rosser property
does not generally hold for $\beta\eta$-reduction of Church-style terms.
\citet{Geuvers92} proved that the Church-Rosser for $\beta\eta$-reduction
holds in functional PTSs. \citet{Seldin08} discusses the relation between
the Church-style typing and the Curry-style typing. 


In a more practial setting (for language implementation)

"Giving Haskell a Propmotion" \cite{YorgeyWCJVM12}
most closely reated work would be this

value dependent types in F-star \cite{Swamy11} from MSR


what others to discuss?
