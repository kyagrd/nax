Among theoretical calculi, \Fi\ is most closely related to
Curry-style System \Fw \cite{AbeMatUus03,AbeMatUus05,GHR93}
and Implicit Calculus of Constructions (ICC) \cite{Miquel01}.
All terms typable in Curry-style System \Fw\ are typable in System \Fi\ 
with the same type, and all terms typable in \Fi\ are typable in ICC
with the same type.\footnote{The $*$ kind in \Fw\ and \Fi\ corresponds
	to \textsf{Set} in ICC.}
We have discussed that we can derive strong normalization, logical consistency,
and subject reduction of \Fi, from \Fw\ and a subset of ICC.
In fact, ICC is more than just an extension of \Fi, as described in our work,
with dependent types and stratified universes. ICC includes $\eta$-reduction
and the extensionality typing rule. We do not foresee any problem of adding
$\eta$-reduction and the extensionality typing rule to \Fi. Although
System \Fi\ accepts less terms than ICC, \Fi\ enjoys more simple
erasure properties (Theorem \ref{thm:ierasetypingifree} and
Theorem \ref{ierasetypingall)}, which ICC cannot not provide
due to its support for full dependent types. In System \Fi, index terms
appearing in types (\eg, $s$ in $F\{s\}$) are always erasable.
\citet{LingerS08} formalized a more generic framework than ICC, which describes
the erasure on arbitrary Church-style calculi (EPTS) and Curry-style calculi
(IPTS), but only consider $\beta$-equivalence for type conversion.

In \S\ref{ssec:rationale}, we have mentioned that Curry-style calculi enjoys
better reduction properties (\eg,$\beta\eta$-reduction is Church-Rosser)
than Church-style calculi. \citet{Nederpelt73} showed a counterexample to
the Church-Rosser property for $\beta\eta$-reduction of Church-style terms.
\citet{Geuvers92} proved that $\beta\eta$-reduction is Church-Rosser
in functional PTSs, which is a certain class of Church-style calculi.
\citet{Seldin08} discusses the relation between the Church-style typing
and the Curry-style typing.
