% Proof assistants have shown its practical use in mechanizing certain
% mathematical proofs \cite{4 color problem}, verifying specifications
% \cite{something}, and mechanizing metatheories of programming languages.
% However, verified programming, or \emph{``correct by construction''} approach
% to programming, is yet far from being practical for everyday programming tasks,
% because proof assistants were designed for aiding formal proof generation,
% not for writing executable programs.


% \subsection{Proof assistants}
% \emph{Proof assistants} based on Curry-Howard correspondence over
% dependently-typed $\lambda$-calculi is a major application area of type theory.
% Such proof assistants can \emph{express fine-grained properties} using
% dependent types and also \emph{guarantee correctness} since they are based on
% strongly normalizing and logically consistent calculi. For instance, Coq is
% based on the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, which is a dependently-typed
% $\lambda$-calculi known to be strongly normalizing and logically consistent.
% 
% Proof assistants have shown its practical use in mechanizing certain
% mathematical proofs \cite{4 color problem}, verifying specifications
% \cite{something}, and mechanizing metatheories of programming languages.
% However, verified programming, or \emph{``correct by construction''} approach
% to programming, is yet far from being practical for everyday programming tasks,
% because proof assistants were designed for aiding formal proof generation,
% not for writing executable programs.

% There are basically two ways of
% \emph{verified programming} in such proof assistants: either
% (1) extract program exploiting Curry-Howard correspondence (shallow embedding)
% or
% (2) write your own verified compiler for your object language (deep embedding).

% since the generated proof term has a notion executable
% semantics (shallow embedding)
% (\ie, cut-elimination corresponds to 
% reduction of proof terms).

% \subsection{Functional programming languages}
% 
% \emph{Functional programming languages} based on type-safe (\ie, if a term
% evaluates to a value, the value has the same type as the original term)
% polymorphic $\lambda$-calculi is another major application of type theory.
% Many popular functional programming languages, such as Haskell\cite{Haskell 98}
% and ML, are based on the Hindley-Milner type system, which is not only
% \emph{type-safe} but also \emph{type-inferable}. Type inference makes type-safe
% programming easy and productive for everyday programming tasks since programmers
% are free from tedious type annotations.
% 
% But, fine-grained properties are not expressible in these functional languages
% due to the lack of dependent types. Even if those fine-grained properties were
% somehow expressible, the type system of these languages cannot give guarantee
% those properties. Recall that general purpose programming languages are neither
% strongly normalizing nor logically consistent, because they are capable of
% expressing diverging computations by design.

\section{Embedding Nax into strongly normalzing calculi}
We will prove strong normalization and logical consistency of Nax
by embedding Nax into a calculi known to have theose desired properties.
We have developed System \Fi, which is an extension of \Fw\ with 
erasable term indices, and proved its properties.\footnote{
	We submitted a paper on System \Fi\ on POPL recently.}
We can embed datatypes of Nax and the \textsf{MIt} and \textsf{MsfIt}
combinator families into System \Fi. But, other combinator families
such as \textsf{MPr} is known to be embeddable into a different
calculus, System \Fixw\ \cite{AbeMat04}, when there are no term indices.
We can similarly extend \Fixw\ with erasable term indices -- we call this
calculus \Fixi, which can embed \textsf{MPr} with term indices.
Properties if \Fixi\ needs to be checked but we strongly believe
that the desired properties, \ie, strong normalization
and logical consistency, will hold in \Fixi\ as well as in \Fi.

\section{Implementation}
We used Haskell and its libraries (\eg, unbound \cite{unbound})
to implement to the proptotpye of Nax.

\section{Summary}

\subsection{Ongoing and future work}
Here is the list of ongoing and future work:
\begin{itemize}
\item Correctness of the type inference algorithm
\item Large eliminations
\item Generalized arrow types in the recursion combinators
\item Non-logical language fragments
\end{itemize}
