H) Dependent types (indexing is a weak form of dependency)

Proof of concept - Implementation

Examples
    functional programming
    indexing
    mutual recursion (even and odd)
    *-kinded indexes (nested datatypes, powerlists bush)
    Simple proof like objects using (more than even or odd)

The embedding would be different from
the embedding of \MPr\ though. The embedding of some families of
the Mendler-style recursion combinators is a pair of translations --
a translation of the recursive type operator, and a translation of
the Mendler style recursion combinator. In general, the translation of
the recursive type operator $\mu^\kappa$ is different for each family
of the Mendler style recursion combinators, even though their target
calculi may coincide.
